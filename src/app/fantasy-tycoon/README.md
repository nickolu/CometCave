# Fantasy Tycoon Event System

## Overview
This module implements an agentic event system for the Fantasy Tycoon game, using LLM-powered event generation and attribute-driven outcome resolution.

### Main Concepts
- **Event Generation:** Uses an LLM to generate structured events with multiple options.
- **Event Resolution:** Resolves user choices based on option probabilities and character attributes.
- **Attribute Management:** Character stats (strength, intelligence, luck, etc.) affect outcomes.

## Key Types
- `FantasyCharacter`: Character with attributes and stats.
- `LLMGeneratedEvent`/`FantasyStoryEvent`: Event objects generated by the LLM or system.
- `FantasyDecisionOption`: Options for decisions, including probability and effects.

## Event Flow
1. **Move Forward**: Calls the LLM to generate events, or produces generic messages.
2. **Display**: UI shows events and options for the player to choose.
3. **Resolve**: The system calculates outcome probabilities using attributes and applies effects.

## Testing
Unit tests are in `__tests__/` for:
- Event generation
- Decision resolution
- Attribute management

## Extending
- Add new attributes to `FantasyCharacter`.
- Update prompt in `llmEventGenerator.ts` to teach the LLM about new schema fields.
- Add new tests as you add logic.
