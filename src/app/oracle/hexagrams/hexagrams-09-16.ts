  [9]: `The Small Taming, also known as the Taming Power of the Small, represents a time when gentle restraint and patient accumulation are necessary. The image is that of wind blowing across heaven - powerful but not yet able to bring rain. This hexagram teaches that great forces may be present, but circumstances require us to work within limitations and build slowly. The judgment promises success through gentle persistence rather than forceful action. In this situation, you possess creative energy and strong intentions, but external conditions constrain your ability to act freely. Like clouds gathering but not yet ready to release their rain, you must continue your preparations and trust in gradual progress. The hexagram counsels acceptance of current limitations while maintaining your vision and purpose. Small steps and careful attention to details will eventually create the conditions for breakthrough. Traditionally, this hexagram appears when your influence is limited to your immediate sphere. You cannot yet move mountains, but you can refine your character, deepen your skills, and strengthen your relationships. In divination, this hexagram suggests focusing on what you can control, perfecting your approach, and trusting that persistence in small matters will eventually open larger opportunities.`,
  [10]: `Treading, also called Conduct, represents how we walk our path in life, especially when navigating dangerous or delicate situations. The image is of treading on the tail of a tiger - it does not bite because you act with proper respect and understanding. This hexagram teaches the art of moving through challenging circumstances with grace, awareness, and appropriate behavior. The judgment emphasizes that through correct conduct, even perilous situations can be traversed safely. Treading shows the relationship between strength and weakness, and how the weak can prevail through understanding the nature of the strong. It speaks to social situations where you must interact with those more powerful than yourself. The key is not to be either too timid or too presumptuous, but to find the middle way of respectful confidence. The hexagram also addresses inner cultivation - treading the path of self-development with sincerity and care. In divination, Treading counsels you to pay attention to your conduct and manners. Success comes through understanding the situation, respecting boundaries, and acting with both courage and propriety. Your behavior and attitude matter more than your position.`,
  [11]: `Peace, also known as Harmony, represents a time when heaven and earth are in communion, when the creative and receptive forces work together in perfect balance. The image shows heaven below and earth above - the natural tendency for heaven to rise and earth to descend creates an intermingling that generates harmony and abundance. This is a time of prosperity, growth, and flowering. The judgment declares this an auspicious time when the small depart and the great approach, when inferior elements give way to superior ones. Peace teaches that harmony is not static but dynamic, a flowing interaction of complementary forces. When this hexagram appears, conditions favor your endeavors, relationships flourish, and obstacles dissolve. However, the wisdom of the I Ching reminds us that all things change - peace contains the seeds of its opposite. The wise person uses times of peace to prepare for future challenges, cultivating strength and wisdom during favorable conditions. In divination, Peace signals a fortunate time for action, relationship building, and launching new ventures. Yet it also counsels mindfulness - do not take harmony for granted, and use this period wisely to create lasting foundations.`,
  [12]: `Standstill, also called Stagnation or Obstruction, represents a time when creative and receptive forces move apart rather than together - heaven rises upward, earth sinks downward, and there is no communication between them. This hexagram depicts a period of blocked progress, misunderstanding, and difficulty. The judgment warns that this is a time when the great depart and the small approach, when inferior elements prevail while superior ones retreat. Standstill teaches us about the inevitable cycles of decline that follow periods of prosperity. During such times, external action may be futile or even dangerous. The wise person withdraws inwardly, preserves their principles, and waits for the time to change. This is not surrender but strategic retreat, maintaining your inner light during outer darkness. The hexagram counsels that attempting to force progress during Standstill only makes matters worse. Instead, focus on inner development, maintain your integrity, and trust that stagnation will eventually give way to renewal. In divination, Standstill suggests that this is not the time for major initiatives or confrontations. Accept the pause, conserve your resources, and use this period for reflection and preparation. The wheel will turn again.`,
  [13]: `Fellowship with Others, also called Community or Companionship, represents the gathering of people in harmony and common purpose. The image shows fire rising toward heaven, illuminating all things equally - this is the spirit of universal fellowship that transcends narrow interests. This hexagram teaches the art of building genuine community based on shared values and mutual respect. The judgment declares that fellowship succeeds through organization and clear principles, and that it is furthered by crossing the great water - by undertaking significant ventures together. Fellowship shows the power of human connection when people unite around a common vision. However, it warns against false fellowship based on selfish interests or exclusive cliques. True fellowship is open, honest, and principled, while false fellowship is secretive and self-serving. The hexagram emphasizes the importance of gathering in the light, in open places, where intentions are clear and motives are pure. In divination, Fellowship encourages you to seek allies, build coalitions, and work together with others toward shared goals. Success comes through collaboration, but ensure that your partnerships are based on genuine compatibility and ethical foundations. This is a time for bringing people together.`,
  [14]: `Great Possession, also known as Abundance or Sovereignty, represents a time of great resources, power, and responsibility. The image shows fire above heaven, illuminating all things from a position of height. This hexagram depicts success, wealth, and influence, but crucially, it teaches how to handle such blessings wisely. The judgment declares supreme success through possession in great measure, but traditional interpretation emphasizes that great possession brings great responsibility. Those who possess much must use their resources for the benefit of all, not for selfish gain. The hexagram teaches that true sovereignty lies not in hoarding but in wise distribution, not in displaying power but in enabling others. Great Possession appears when you have achieved significant success or control valuable resources - material, intellectual, or spiritual. The challenge is to avoid the pitfalls of arrogance, greed, or complacency. The wise person remains humble, shares generously, and uses their abundance to create more good in the world. In divination, this hexagram signals favorable conditions and access to resources, but counsels that your character will be tested by success. Use your blessings wisely and remember that all possession is temporary stewardship.`,
  [15]: `Modesty, also called Humility, represents the virtue that brings all things to completion and creates lasting success. The image shows the mountain beneath the earth - the high is brought low, symbolizing the natural movement toward balance and harmony. This hexagram teaches that true greatness lies in modesty, and that those who diminish themselves are naturally elevated. The judgment declares that modesty creates success and enables one to carry things through to completion. Modesty is praised in all traditional wisdom as the quality that prevents overreaching and invites support from others. This hexagram shows how the modest person naturally finds the middle way, avoiding both self-aggrandizement and false humility. Modesty is not weakness but strength under control, confidence without arrogance. It creates space for growth, learning, and genuine connection with others. When the accomplished person remains humble, they continue to develop and attract opportunities. The hexagram also teaches that modesty works on all levels - in personal conduct, in assessing situations, and in pursuing goals. In divination, Modesty counsels you to take a humble approach to your current situation. Success comes not through self-promotion but through genuine capability combined with unassuming conduct. Let your actions speak louder than your words.`,
  [16]: `Enthusiasm, also called Harmonious Eagerness, represents the power of inspiration and the willing response that it generates. The image shows thunder coming out of the earth with tremendous force, like the first stirrings of spring that bring all of nature to life. This hexagram teaches about leadership that inspires genuine enthusiasm rather than compels through force. The judgment declares that enthusiasm makes it possible to install helpers and set armies marching - people respond with willing commitment when they are genuinely moved. Enthusiasm arises when there is resonance between leader and led, when vision aligns with the natural movement of the times. The hexagram shows the power of music, ritual, and shared celebration to unite people in common feeling and purpose. However, it warns that enthusiasm must be genuine and appropriate to the situation. False enthusiasm or forced excitement leads nowhere. True enthusiasm connects to something deeper - a shared vision, a noble cause, or the joy of creation itself. In divination, Enthusiasm signals a time when you can inspire others and generate momentum for your projects. The key is authenticity - your own genuine passion will naturally kindle enthusiasm in others. This is a favorable time for leadership, creative projects, and collective endeavors.`,

    `Line 1: Fellowship with others in the open. No blame. Begin fellowship in transparency and openness. Meet in public places, declare your intentions honestly, and build community on clear foundations. When nothing is hidden, trust develops naturally. Open fellowship creates lasting bonds.`,
    `Line 2: Fellowship with others within the clan. Humiliation. This line warns against exclusive fellowship limited to your own group.

    `Line 3: One hides weapons in the thicket. One climbs the high hill in front of it. For three years one does not rise up. Mistrust and hidden agendas poison fellowship.

    `Line 6: Fellowship with others in the meadow. No remorse. While not the deepest fellowship, this represents harmony without complete unity.

    `Line 1: No relationship with what is harmful. No blame. Blame passes away if one remains conscious of difficulty.

    `Line 2: A big wagon for loading. One may undertake something. No blame. You have the capacity and resources to carry great weight and accomplish significant tasks. Your abundant resources enable you to take on substantial projects. This is the proper use of great possession - putting your capabilities to work for meaningful purposes.`,

    `Line 1: Enthusiasm that expresses itself brings misfortune. At the beginning, premature display of enthusiasm or self-congratulation leads to problems. Do not announce your excitement before you have accomplished anything. Enthusiasm should inspire action, not replace it. Wait until you have something real to celebrate.`,
    `Line 2: Firm as a rock. Not a whole day. Perseverance brings good fortune.

This line depicts the dilemma of misplaced enthusiasm - neither blind following nor paralyzed inaction serves you. Find your own authentic response.`,
    `Line 4: The source of enthusiasm. One obtains great success. One's doubts are overcome, and companions gather around like a clasp gathers hair. You become a source of genuine inspiration for others. Your authentic enthusiasm dissolves doubts and naturally draws people together. This is leadership through inspiration - people willingly gather because they are genuinely moved by your vision and energy.`,
    `Line 5: Persistently ill, and still does not die. In a position of leadership, you face ongoing challenges that drain enthusiasm. Yet you endure. This line depicts the difficulty of maintaining inspiration during prolonged adversity. Though circumstances are not fatal, they are persistently difficult. Your persistence through this trial is itself a form of enthusiasm.`,
    `Line 6: Deluded enthusiasm. If one changes after completion, there is no blame. At the extreme, enthusiasm becomes delusion - you have become carried away by excitement detached from reality. However, if you recognize this and change course even after committing yourself, you can still avoid serious harm. Self-correction redeems the situation.`,
