  [1]: `The Creative represents pure yang energy, the primal force of heaven that initiates all action and manifestation. Symbolized by six unbroken lines, this hexagram embodies the masculine principle of strength, creativity, and forward momentum. It is the dragon energy that rises from the depths, bringing inspiration, leadership, and the power to create something from nothing. The Creative is associated with the sky, with light, and with the generative force that sets all things in motion.\n\nThe Judgment speaks of supreme success through perseverance. When you receive this hexagram, it indicates a time of great potential and creative power. However, this power must be wielded with wisdom and timing. Like the dragon in Chinese mythology, one must know when to remain hidden in the depths, when to appear in the fields, and when to soar to the heights. The key is to act in harmony with natural law and to lead through inner strength rather than force.\n\nIn practical terms, The Creative signals a time to take initiative, to lead, and to manifest your vision. This is a highly auspicious hexagram for new ventures, creative projects, and assuming positions of leadership. Yet it also carries a warning against arrogance and overreaching. True creative power comes from alignment with the Tao, with the natural order of things. Act with confidence but remain humble, pursue your goals with vigor but stay grounded in principle.\n\nWhen this hexagram appears in divination, trust your inner strength and vision. The time is favorable for bold action, but success depends on maintaining integrity and perseverance. Like heaven itself, be constant in your purpose, generous in your spirit, and unwavering in your commitment to what is right and true.`,
  [2]: `The Receptive embodies pure yin energy, the primal feminine force of earth that receives, nurtures, and brings all things to fruition. Symbolized by six broken lines, this hexagram represents devotion, receptivity, and the power of yielding. While The Creative initiates, The Receptive completes. It is the fertile ground in which seeds grow, the mother who gives form to heaven\'s creative impulse. This is not weakness but a different kind of strength - the strength to support, adapt, and endure.\n\nThe Judgment teaches that The Receptive achieves success through the perseverance of a mare - steadfast, gentle, and following the path with unwavering dedication. When you lead by following, when you accomplish through allowing, when you win by yielding, you embody The Receptive. This hexagram counsels us to be like the earth: spacious enough to hold all things, stable enough to support life, and generous enough to nourish growth without demanding recognition.\n\nIn divination, The Receptive indicates a time to follow rather than lead, to listen rather than speak, to respond rather than initiate. This is not a passive state but an active receptivity. Like the earth that receives the rain and transforms it into harvest, you must actively receive opportunities, guidance, and influences, then transform them through patient work. Success comes through cooperation, service, and devotion to what is greater than yourself.\n\nWhen this hexagram appears, trust in the power of receptivity. Find strength in flexibility, wisdom in following, and success in supporting others. The Receptive achieves greatness not through assertion but through perfect alignment with the way things naturally unfold.`,
  [3]: `Difficulty at the Beginning depicts the challenges that arise when new things first emerge into the world. The image shows clouds and thunder - creative forces gathering before the rain, suggesting the chaos and confusion that precede order. This hexagram represents birth pangs, initial obstacles, and the struggle to establish something new. Just as a blade of grass must push through hard earth to reach the light, all beginnings involve effort and perseverance. The Judgment counsels appointing helpers and not attempting everything alone - difficult times require support and organization.\n\nIn traditional interpretation, this hexagram describes the moment when yang first stirs within yin, when potential begins to actualize. There is energy and possibility, but also confusion and lack of clear direction. Like a newborn creature, what is emerging is vulnerable and needs careful tending. The difficulty is not a sign of failure but a natural part of the creative process. Success comes through patience, perseverance, and the wisdom to build foundations before attempting to complete the structure.\n\nIn divination, Difficulty at the Beginning indicates you are at the start of something new and should expect initial obstacles. This is not the time to give up but to persist with determination while being realistic about challenges. Don\'t expect immediate clarity or smooth progress - new ventures naturally involve confusion and setbacks. The key is to keep moving forward despite difficulties, gather capable people around you, and focus on establishing a firm foundation. What seems impossible now will become easier as order gradually emerges from chaos.\n\nThis hexagram ultimately carries a positive message: difficulties at the beginning are normal and surmountable. Your situation contains great potential that will manifest as you work through initial challenges with patience and proper support.`,
  [4]: `Youthful Folly represents inexperience, naivety, and the teachable state of not-knowing. The image shows a spring at the foot of the mountain - water that has just emerged and has not yet found its course, flowing in confused directions. This hexagram depicts the immature mind that lacks knowledge and discipline, yet possesses the potential for growth. The Judgment teaches that success comes not through the teacher seeking the student, but through the student sincerely seeking the teacher. Youthful folly is not a permanent state but a necessary stage of development.\n\nThe traditional interpretation emphasizes the relationship between teacher and student, knowledge and ignorance. When we are in a state of youthful folly, we don\'t know what we don\'t know. This can manifest as overconfidence, making preventable mistakes, or wandering without clear direction. However, this state is not to be despised but educated. The hexagram suggests that ignorance itself is not problematic - what matters is the attitude toward learning. A humble, sincere student will be taught, while an arrogant or insincere one will be left to their folly.\n\nIn divination, Youthful Folly may indicate that you (or someone involved in your situation) lacks necessary experience or understanding. This is not a criticism but an invitation to learning. If you are the one lacking knowledge, seek genuine teachers and admit what you don\'t know. If you are dealing with someone else\'s inexperience, recognize that patience and proper guidance are needed. This hexagram also warns against arrogance - thinking you know more than you do will lead to mistakes.\n\nThe positive aspect of Youthful Folly is potential. Like clay that can still be shaped, the inexperienced mind can learn and grow. Embrace this beginner\'s state, ask questions, and be willing to be taught.`,
  [5]: `Waiting represents the art of patient anticipation when the time is not yet ripe for action. The image shows clouds rising toward heaven, carrying the promise of rain but not yet releasing it. This hexagram teaches that there are moments when forward movement would be premature or even dangerous, and wisdom lies in conscious waiting. The Judgment counsels sincerity, brilliance, and perseverance while waiting, and emphasizes the importance of nourishment - both physical and spiritual sustenance that maintains strength during periods of inactivity. Waiting is not passive resignation but active preparation.\n\nThis hexagram depicts standing before a dangerous situation - traditionally symbolized by water or an abyss ahead - where rushing forward would lead to harm. The wise person recognizes that conditions have not yet aligned for successful action. During this time of waiting, one must maintain inner strength, clarity of purpose, and readiness to act when the moment arrives. Like a farmer who cannot make seeds grow faster but can tend the field while waiting for harvest, you must use this time productively without forcing premature results.\n\nIn divination, Waiting indicates that you must exercise patience regarding your current question or situation. This is not the time to push forward aggressively or demand immediate results. Instead, prepare yourself, conserve your resources, and maintain your focus while external conditions ripen. The hexagram promises that what you wait for will come, but only in its proper time. Trust the process and use this period to strengthen your position, deepen your understanding, and nourish your spirit.\n\nWaiting can feel frustrating, but this hexagram assures you that your patience will be rewarded. The key is to wait with purpose rather than anxiety, maintaining inner certainty that the right moment will arrive and you will recognize it when it does.`,
  [6]: `Conflict represents discord, dispute, and opposition that arises when different forces or intentions collide. The image shows heaven moving upward while water flows downward - their contrary nature creates tension and struggle. This hexagram acknowledges that conflict is sometimes inevitable in human affairs, but it counsels careful handling of disputes. The Judgment teaches that it is favorable to see the great person and meet in the middle, but warns against pushing things to the bitter end. Conflict that escalates to extremes brings misfortune, while conflict handled with wisdom and moderation can lead to resolution.\n\nIn traditional interpretation, Conflict arises from differences in goals, values, or interests that cannot be easily reconciled. The hexagram suggests that the root of most conflicts lies in subjective convictions - each party believes they are right. When you are certain of your position and encounter someone equally certain of theirs, collision is natural. The wisdom lies not in avoiding all conflict, which is impossible, but in how you engage with it. Seeking mediation, compromising where possible, and knowing when to withdraw are all forms of skillful conflict management.\n\nIn divination, Conflict indicates that you are experiencing or will soon face opposition, disagreement, or struggle. This hexagram counsels against stubborn insistence on your viewpoint or pushing for total victory. Instead, seek wise counsel from neutral parties, look for common ground, and be willing to compromise. If you are in the right, moderate assertion of your position is appropriate, but aggressive pursuit of conflict will backfire. Sometimes the wisest response to conflict is strategic withdrawal rather than engagement.\n\nThis hexagram reminds us that not every battle needs to be fought and not every argument needs to be won. Consider whether the conflict serves a genuine purpose or merely feeds ego and stubbornness. Choose your conflicts wisely.`,
  [7]: `The Army represents organized collective force, discipline, and leadership in times that demand coordinated action. The image shows water beneath the earth, suggesting hidden reserves of strength that can be mobilized when needed. This hexagram depicts not chaotic violence but structured, disciplined action led by experienced authority. The Judgment emphasizes that the army needs the right leader - someone mature, capable, and morally grounded - and that only then can there be good fortune without blame. The Army speaks to situations requiring organization, strategy, and the marshaling of resources toward a common goal.\n\nTraditionally, this hexagram relates to military affairs, but its wisdom applies to any situation requiring disciplined collective effort. Whether organizing a project, managing a crisis, or coordinating group action, the principles remain the same: clear hierarchy, competent leadership, shared purpose, and disciplined execution. The hexagram warns that such concentrated force is dangerous if misused, which is why the character and wisdom of leadership matter so greatly. Power must be wielded justly and for legitimate purposes, not for personal gain or unjust causes.\n\nIn divination, The Army suggests that your situation requires organization, strategy, and possibly the mobilization of resources or people. You may need to take on a leadership role, coordinate group efforts, or approach your challenge with military-like discipline and planning. This hexagram favors structured, strategic approaches over spontaneous action. It also indicates that the stakes are significant enough to warrant serious, coordinated effort. However, it counsels that leadership must be earned and exercised wisely - authority without moral grounding leads to disaster.\n\nThe Army reminds us that collective action can achieve what individuals cannot, but only when properly organized and led. Consider whether you have the right person directing affairs, whether the cause is just, and whether discipline and strategy are being applied appropriately.`,
  [8]: `Holding Together represents union, alliance, and the power of mutual support. The image shows water on the earth, symbolizing how water naturally seeks and finds its level, gathering together in streams, rivers, and lakes. This hexagram teaches that just as water collects in low places, people naturally gather around central figures or shared purposes. The Judgment speaks of inquiring whether you possess the necessary qualities to serve as a center of union - questioning whether you have the clarity, constancy, and character to hold people together. Those who arrive late may miss the opportunity to join this beneficial union.\n\nThe traditional interpretation emphasizes the importance of finding or creating the right relationships and alliances. Holding Together is about more than mere proximity - it requires genuine affinity, shared values, and mutual commitment. The hexagram suggests that some have natural qualities that attract others and create bonds of loyalty, while those lacking these qualities find themselves isolated. The question posed by this hexagram is deeply personal: Are you the kind of person others naturally want to ally with? Do you inspire trust and confidence? Or are you seeking to connect with those who possess these qualities?\n\nIn divination, Holding Together indicates that success in your situation depends on alliance, partnership, and mutual support. You cannot achieve your aims alone - you need others, or others need you. This is a favorable hexagram for forming partnerships, joining groups, or seeking support from like-minded people. However, it also poses a serious question about timing and worthiness. If you wish to join something or someone, you must do so sincerely and while the opportunity remains open. If you wish others to gather around you, you must cultivate the qualities that inspire trust and loyalty.\n\nThe deeper wisdom of Holding Together is that genuine union cannot be forced or faked. It arises naturally when the right people, purposes, and timing align. Be sincere in your alliances, and choose your associations wisely.`,

    `Line 1: Hidden dragon. Do not act. At the beginning, your power and potential are not yet ready to manifest. Like a dragon resting in the depths of the lake, you possess great capability but the time has not yet come to reveal yourself. This line counsels patience and preparation. Use this time to cultivate your strength, deepen your understanding, and develop your abilities without seeking recognition. Premature action would be wasted effort. Remain hidden and continue your inner work until conditions ripen.`,
    `Line 2: Dragon appearing in the field. It furthers one to see the great person. Your abilities begin to emerge and become visible to others. This is the time to seek guidance from those with experience and wisdom. The dragon rises from the depths to the surface, but does not yet take to the sky. Make yourself available to be of service, share your growing capabilities with others, and learn from mentors who can help you refine your talents. Recognition begins to come, but humility remains essential.`,
    `Line 3: The superior person is creatively active all day long. At nightfall, their mind is still beset with cares. Danger. No blame. In a position of transition, you find yourself working tirelessly, balancing ambition with caution. There is danger in this intensity - the risk of overextension or exhaustion. However, if you remain conscious of the dangers and maintain vigilance, no blame will come. This line depicts the natural anxiety of one who takes responsibility seriously. Your conscientiousness protects you from the mistakes that come from carelessness.`,
    `Line 4: Wavering flight over the depths. No blame. At a high position, you face a choice between advancing further or returning to safety. The image is of the dragon hovering uncertainly over the abyss. This hesitation is not weakness but wisdom. In times of uncertainty, there is no shame in pausing to assess conditions rather than plunging ahead recklessly. Flexibility and the willingness to retreat if necessary demonstrate mature judgment. The key is to remain true to your principles while adapting to circumstances.`,
    `Line 5: Flying dragon in the heavens. It furthers one to see the great person. This is the position of realized creative power, where your abilities find their fullest expression and greatest influence. The dragon soars at its proper height, visible to all, exercising leadership with wisdom and grace. This line represents success, recognition, and the proper use of authority. However, even at this height, seek counsel from other worthy individuals. True greatness is never isolated but remains connected to the wisdom of others.`,
    `Line 6: Arrogant dragon will have cause to repent. The danger of overreaching appears when one flies too high without maintaining connection to principles and reality. Ambition has pushed beyond sustainable limits, and pride precedes a fall. This line warns that excessive striving, arrogance, or the refusal to recognize natural limits brings inevitable regret. The creative force that brought success can become destructive when it loses balance and humility. Recognize when you have reached your proper limit and do not attempt to exceed it.`,

    `Line 1: When there is hoarfrost underfoot, solid ice is not far off. The first subtle signs of negative influences appear. Like the first frost of winter, these early indications seem small but signal larger developments to come. This line counsels awareness and early action. By recognizing the pattern when it first emerges, you can prepare for what follows. The Receptive's wisdom lies in sensitivity to subtle changes and the understanding that small beginnings lead to significant outcomes. Take note of early warnings and respond with appropriate caution.`,
    `Line 2: Straight, square, great. Without purpose, yet nothing remains unfurthered. In perfect receptivity, you embody the qualities of earth - straightforward, stable, and capacious. Your nature is so aligned with the Tao that you need no conscious strategy; everything you do naturally produces beneficial results. This line depicts the power of authentic receptivity: by being genuinely yourself and responding naturally to circumstances, you achieve success effortlessly. Like earth that simply is what it is, your authenticity and steadfastness create the conditions for growth.`,
    `Line 3: Hidden lines. One is able to remain persevering. If by chance you are in the service of a king, seek not works, but bring to completion. In a subordinate position, your abilities may not be immediately recognized. The wise response is to continue your devoted work without seeking credit or attention. Like hidden lines of strength within the earth, your contribution may not be visible but is nonetheless essential. This line teaches the nobility of service without recognition and the importance of completing tasks for their own sake rather than for external reward.`,
    `Line 4: A tied-up sack. No blame, no praise. Sometimes the wisest course is to maintain reserve and restraint. Like a tied sack that neither spills nor displays its contents, you keep your resources and opinions to yourself. In uncertain times or when surrounded by those who might misuse what you offer, discretion serves you well. This line indicates a time when neither advancing nor revealing yourself is appropriate. By remaining closed and contained, you avoid both mistakes and achievements - a neutral position that protects you from harm.`,
    `Line 5: A yellow lower garment brings supreme good fortune. Yellow is the color of earth and represents reliability, loyalty, and inner worth. The lower garment, being hidden beneath outer robes, suggests inner beauty and substance that does not seek display. In a position of influence, your inner cultivation and authentic character bring success. This line teaches that true greatness comes from inner qualities rather than outer show. By maintaining humility, sincerity, and genuine virtue, you achieve the highest form of success - recognition that comes naturally from worth rather than from self-promotion.`,
    `Line 6: Dragons fight in the meadow. Their blood is black and yellow. When receptive force tries to exceed its proper nature and compete with creative force, conflict and destruction result. This line warns against abandoning the receptive principle in favor of aggressive assertion. When yielding becomes rigid, when following becomes leading inappropriately, the natural order is violated and harm follows. The image of dragons fighting shows forces that should complement each other instead engaged in destructive conflict. Know your true nature and do not try to be what you are not.`,

  [3]: [
    `Line 1: Hesitation and hindrance. It furthers one to remain persevering. It furthers one to appoint helpers. At the very beginning, obstacles seem overwhelming and you may feel paralyzed by the difficulty before you. The path forward is unclear, and each step feels uncertain. This line counsels persistence despite confusion, and emphasizes the importance of seeking assistance. You cannot navigate these initial difficulties alone. By maintaining determination and gathering capable people around you, you create the conditions for eventual breakthrough. Do not give up simply because the beginning is hard.`,
    `Line 2: Difficulties pile up. Horse and wagon part. He is not a robber; he will woo at the right time. Ten years - then she pledges herself. Initial obstacles create misunderstandings and separations. What seems like rejection or abandonment is actually a matter of timing. This line teaches patience when circumstances prevent union or progress. The intentions are good, but conditions are not yet right. Like a suitor who must wait ten years before his suit is accepted, you must trust that what is meant to be will manifest when the time is right. Do not force premature conclusions or mistake delays for permanent obstacles.`,
    `Line 3: Whoever hunts deer without the forester only loses their way in the forest. The superior person understands the signs and prefers to desist. No blame in giving up. Attempting to navigate difficult new territory without proper guidance leads to being lost. This line warns against proceeding without necessary knowledge or expertise. There is wisdom and no shame in recognizing when you lack sufficient understanding to continue. Better to pause, seek guidance, or even abandon an ill-conceived venture than to persist stubbornly into deeper confusion. Sometimes giving up is the most intelligent choice.`,
    `Line 4: Horse and wagon part. Strive for union. To go brings good fortune. Everything acts to further. Despite difficulties, persistence toward connection and unity brings success. This line appears when separation and obstacles can be overcome through sincere effort and right action. Unlike the second line where waiting is advised, here active striving toward union is the correct path. When your intentions are correct and your methods appropriate, even significant obstacles can be surmounted. The universe supports sincere efforts to create beneficial connections.`,
    `Line 5: Difficulties in blessing. A little perseverance brings good fortune. Great perseverance brings misfortune. You wish to provide help or benefits but face obstacles in doing so. The key is measured effort - modest persistence succeeds while excessive striving creates problems. This line teaches discernment between appropriate and inappropriate levels of effort. Sometimes our desire to help can become forcing or meddling. Offer what you can with gentle persistence, but recognize when greater pushing would be counterproductive. Allow others to receive your benefits in their own time and way.`,
    `Line 6: Horse and wagon part. One weeps tears of blood. At the extreme of Difficulty at the Beginning, the pain of separation and obstacle becomes almost unbearable. This line depicts profound disappointment and grief when obstacles prevent what seems crucial. However, even this extreme difficulty is not permanent. The teaching is that when we reach the limit of difficulty, transformation becomes possible. Your tears water the ground from which new growth will eventually emerge. Even in deepest despair, the cycle continues and renewal will come.`,

  [4]: [
    `Line 1: To unfold folly it furthers one to apply discipline. A person should be disciplined with fetters. To go on in this way brings humiliation. At the beginning of learning, discipline and structure are essential. The young fool needs clear boundaries and correction to develop properly. However, this discipline must be appropriate - too much restriction becomes humiliating and counterproductive. This line teaches that education requires a balance: enough structure to prevent the student from wandering into harm, but not so much control that growth is stifled. The goal is development, not mere compliance.`,
    `Line 2: To bear with fools in kindliness brings good fortune. To know how to take women brings good fortune. The son is capable of taking charge of the household. In the midst of youthful folly, this line shows someone mature enough to handle responsibility despite inexperience. The key is receptivity and kindness - being able to work with others despite their limitations, including one's own. This represents the student who has progressed beyond mere ignorance to become capable of practical application. Success comes through humility, the ability to learn from anyone, and genuine capability in worldly affairs.`,
    `Line 3: Take not a maiden who, when she sees a man of bronze, loses possession of herself. Nothing furthers. This line warns against being seduced by superficial attractions or external power. The young fool who loses self-control when dazzled by wealth or status cannot maintain integrity or independent judgment. Do not let yourself be swept away by impressive appearances or abandon your center for what merely glitters. True maturity requires maintaining your sovereignty even in the presence of powerful or attractive influences.`,
    `Line 4: Entangled folly brings humiliation. The fool who remains trapped in confusion, refusing to seek knowledge or guidance, inevitably suffers the consequences of ignorance. This line depicts willful ignorance rather than innocent inexperience - the folly of one who could learn but chooses not to. When we cling to our confusion or take pride in not knowing, we create our own humiliation. The teaching is clear: there is no virtue in remaining foolish when learning is available. Seek knowledge before circumstances force painful lessons upon you.`,
    `Line 5: Childlike folly brings good fortune. This is the folly of innocence and openness, not of stubbornness or pride. Like a child who asks questions sincerely and learns eagerly, this line represents the ideal student attitude. There is no shame in not knowing; the shame lies in pretending to know or refusing to learn. Childlike folly is blessed because it contains genuine curiosity, humility, and the willingness to be taught. This attitude naturally attracts good teachers and leads to authentic learning.`,
    `Line 6: In punishing folly it does not further one to commit transgressions. The only thing that furthers is to prevent transgressions. At the extreme, education requires firm boundaries to prevent serious mistakes. However, even correction must be done rightly - punishment should prevent future errors, not merely inflict harm or demonstrate power. This line teaches that discipline serves development, not dominance. When correcting youthful folly, the goal is always to prevent the fool from harming themselves or others, not to gratify the ego of the teacher. Set clear limits with compassion, not cruelty.`,
  ],
  [5]: [
    `Line 1: Waiting in the meadow. It furthers one to abide in what endures. No blame. At the beginning of waiting, you are still far from the danger or challenge ahead. This is the most comfortable stage of waiting - nothing immediately threatens, and you have time to prepare. The counsel is to maintain your position and abide in what is enduring: your principles, your practices, your steady course. By remaining constant in the fundamentals while danger is still distant, you build the foundation of strength that will serve you when challenges arrive.`,
    `Line 2: Waiting on the sand. There is some gossip. The end brings good fortune. As you draw closer to the challenge, minor difficulties appear. Criticism, rumors, or small obstacles begin to test your patience. The sand suggests you are near the water but not yet in it - difficulties approach but have not fully arrived. This line counsels tolerance of these minor irritations without losing your composure or direction. Those who can maintain calm despite gossip and small provocations will find that patience leads to good fortune when the real test arrives.`,
    `Line 3: Waiting in the mud brings about the arrival of the enemy. Now you stand at the edge of danger, and the situation becomes precarious. The mud suggests you are in contact with the difficulty - close enough that it affects your position and comfort. Your waiting has brought you to the threshold of conflict or challenge. This line warns that danger is no longer distant but approaching directly. Maintain your vigilance and inner strength, as the confrontation you have been anticipating is at hand. Your patient preparation will now be tested.`,
    `Line 4: Waiting in blood. Get out of the pit. The danger has arrived, and you find yourself in a truly perilous situation. Blood represents injury and actual harm. The pit is a place of entrapment. Yet even in this extreme circumstance, there is a way forward: get out. This line teaches that when danger fully manifests, sometimes the wisest response is to extricate yourself however you can. There is no shame in retreating from an impossible situation. Survival and escape take priority over maintaining your original position. Live to wait another day.`,
    `Line 5: Waiting at meat and drink. Perseverance brings good fortune. After passing through danger or while waiting continues, take care of your basic needs. Do not become so focused on waiting and anticipation that you neglect nourishment and sustenance. This line teaches the importance of maintaining your strength during long periods of waiting. Eat well, rest well, and tend to your physical and spiritual health. Perseverance is possible only when you properly nourish yourself. The image suggests hospitality and proper care during the waiting period.`,
    `Line 6: One falls into the pit. Three uninvited guests arrive. Honor them, and in the end there will be good fortune. At the completion of waiting, unexpected developments occur. What seemed like falling into misfortune actually brings opportunity in disguise. The three uninvited guests represent unforeseen help or unexpected solutions. This line teaches that after long waiting, resolution may come from surprising directions. When circumstances change suddenly, receive what comes with respect and openness rather than suspicion. What appears unwelcome may prove to be exactly what you need.`,
  ],
  [6]: [
    `Line 1: If one does not perpetuate the affair, there is a little gossip. In the end, good fortune. At the beginning of conflict, you have the opportunity to prevent escalation. By refusing to continue the dispute, by not feeding the conflict with more argument or action, you allow it to dissipate naturally. There may be some criticism of your restraint - others might mistake your wisdom for weakness - but ultimately, letting go of conflict brings good fortune. This line teaches that the easiest time to resolve conflict is at its inception, before positions harden and pride becomes invested in winning.`,
    `Line 2: One cannot engage in conflict; one returns home and gives way. The people of the town, three hundred households, remain free of guilt. Recognizing that you cannot win this conflict, you withdraw strategically. By yielding and returning to your proper place, you not only protect yourself but also prevent harm from spreading to others who depend on you. This line teaches the nobility of strategic retreat and the responsibility of leadership to protect followers from unnecessary conflict. Sometimes the greatest strength lies in knowing when not to fight.`,
    `Line 3: To nourish oneself on ancient virtue induces perseverance. Danger. In the end, good fortune. If one is in the service of a king, seek no works. In the midst of conflict, find your strength in enduring principles and traditional wisdom rather than in striving for victory or recognition. There is danger in this position - the conflict continues and you remain in it - but by maintaining connection to what is timelessly true, you eventually find good fortune. This line counsels humility and principle over ambition during contentious times. Do your duty without seeking credit or advancement.`,
    `Line 4: One cannot engage in conflict. One turns back and submits to fate, changes one's attitude, and finds peace in perseverance. Good fortune. This line shows the turning point where you recognize the futility of conflict and consciously choose a different path. Rather than continuing to struggle against what cannot be changed, you accept your situation and transform your inner attitude. This is not defeat but wisdom - changing what you can change (your attitude) rather than exhausting yourself against what you cannot change (the external situation). This inner transformation brings genuine peace and good fortune.`,
    `Line 5: To contend before the supreme judge brings supreme good fortune. In certain conflicts, seeking the judgment of a recognized authority or neutral arbiter is the correct path. This line represents bringing disputes before one who can truly adjudicate fairly. Unlike forcing your will or continuing endless argument, you trust the process of formal judgment. When the matter is serious enough and the authority legitimate, this brings the best possible outcome. The teaching is that some conflicts require formal resolution rather than personal settlement.`,
    `Line 6: Even if by chance a leather belt is bestowed upon one, by the end of morning it will have been snatched away three times. Victory in conflict proves empty and temporary. Even if you win recognition or rewards through contentious striving, you will not be able to hold onto them. What is gained through conflict is lost through conflict. This line warns that pursuing victory in disputes ultimately brings no lasting benefit. The prize, even if temporarily grasped, will slip away repeatedly. Better never to enter such conflicts than to win hollow victories that cannot be sustained.`,

  [7]: [
    `Line 1: An army must set forth in proper order. If the order is not good, misfortune threatens. At the beginning of collective action, organization and discipline are paramount. Without proper structure and clear command, even the best intentions lead to chaos and failure. This line emphasizes that the foundation of any coordinated effort must be sound ordering - clear roles, proper hierarchy, and agreed-upon rules of conduct. Do not rush into action before establishing proper organization. The quality of your initial structure determines the outcome of the entire endeavor.`,
    `Line 2: In the midst of the army. Good fortune. No blame. The king bestows a triple decoration. The successful leader remains with their people, sharing their hardships and dangers. This line depicts leadership that earns loyalty through personal presence and shared sacrifice. When you remain in the midst of difficulties alongside those you lead, you gain their trust and inspire their best efforts. Recognition and honor come naturally to such leadership, not because it is sought, but because it is genuinely earned. This is the model of leadership through example and presence.`,
    `Line 3: Perchance the army carries corpses in the wagon. Misfortune. This line warns of the dangers when leadership fails or is divided. Carrying corpses suggests that death and defeat have occurred - the campaign has gone badly. This may result from poor decisions, inadequate leadership, or unclear command structure. When authority is misused or when those unqualified direct affairs, disaster follows. The teaching is clear: The Army requires competent, moral leadership. Without it, organized force becomes merely organized destruction, harming even those it should protect.`,
    `Line 4: The army retreats. No blame. Strategic retreat is not failure but wisdom. When conditions do not favor success, when the enemy is too strong or circumstances too difficult, the wise leader withdraws to preserve their forces for a better opportunity. This line teaches that knowing when to retreat is as important as knowing when to advance. There is no shame in tactical withdrawal - it demonstrates prudence and care for those under your command. The goal is ultimate success, not the pride of never yielding ground.`,
    `Line 5: There is game in the field. It furthers one to catch it. Without blame. Let the eldest lead the army. The younger transports corpses; then perseverance brings misfortune. When facing a real enemy or challenge, proper leadership structure becomes crucial. The experienced, mature leader must command, while less experienced members support. If the young or inexperienced are given primary authority, even persistence leads to misfortune. This line teaches respect for experience and wisdom in times of serious challenge. Capability and maturity must guide action; enthusiasm alone is insufficient. The right person must be in the right role.`,
    `Line 6: The great prince issues commands, founds states, vests families with fiefs. Inferior people should not be employed. At the conclusion of collective action, rewards must be distributed and order established. However, this line carries an important warning: do not elevate inferior people to positions of power. After success, there is a temptation to reward loyalty without regard to character or capability. The wise leader recognizes that the quality of those given authority determines future stability. Honor the worthy, but do not place power in unworthy hands, no matter their service or loyalty.`,

    `Line 1: Hold to him in truth and loyalty; this is without blame. Truth, like a full earthen bowl - thus in the end good fortune comes from without. At the beginning of seeking union, your sincerity and loyalty create the foundation for genuine alliance. Like a bowl that is genuinely full, your authentic commitment attracts beneficial connections. This line teaches that holding together begins with your own inner integrity and sincere intention. When you approach others with genuine openness and trustworthy character, fortune comes to you from external sources. You need not force connection; your authenticity naturally draws the right relationships.`,
    `Line 2: Hold to him inwardly. Perseverance brings good fortune. The alliance or connection must come from inner conviction, not external pressure or superficial attraction. This line emphasizes authenticity in relationship - you unite with others because of genuine affinity and shared values, not from convenience or compulsion. When holding together is rooted in inner truth and maintained through steadfast commitment, it brings lasting good fortune. Do not be swayed by external opinions about whom you should ally with; trust your inner knowing about right associations.`,
    `Line 3: You hold together with the wrong people. Beware of allying with those who do not share your values or whose character is questionable. This line warns against associations formed from desperation, loneliness, or poor judgment. When you connect with the wrong people, the holding together itself becomes problematic. Sometimes isolation is preferable to false alliance. This teaching emphasizes the importance of discrimination in choosing your associations. Not all holding together is beneficial; some unions are harmful. Be willing to be alone rather than compromise by joining with those who will lead you astray.`,
    `Line 4: Hold to him outwardly also. Perseverance brings good fortune. After inner conviction is established, your alliance must also become visible and publicly acknowledged. This line teaches that genuine holding together eventually requires outward commitment and recognition. Private connection must mature into public alliance. When inner and outer are aligned - when you are committed both internally and externally - the relationship becomes truly solid and brings good fortune. Do not keep beneficial connections hidden or ambiguous; let them be known and honored appropriately.`,
    `Line 5: Manifestation of holding together. In the hunt, the king uses beaters on three sides only and forgoes game that runs off in front. The citizens need no warning. Good fortune. This depicts leadership that attracts followers naturally through character rather than force. Like a king who generously allows game to escape rather than trapping it completely, true leadership does not coerce or compel. Those who wish to leave are free to go; those who remain do so by choice. This line teaches that the highest form of holding together is voluntary - people unite around you because they recognize your worth, not because they are trapped or manipulated. Such natural alliance brings supreme good fortune.`,
    `Line 6: One finds no head for holding together. Misfortune. At the extreme, the attempt to hold together lacks the central organizing principle or leadership necessary for genuine union. Without a clear center or unifying purpose, alliance dissolves into confusion. This line warns that holding together requires either a worthy leader or a compelling shared vision. When these are absent, no amount of effort can create lasting union. The teaching is to recognize when the conditions for genuine alliance do not exist and to not force connection where no true center can be found.`,
