  [41]: `Decrease (Sun) represents the natural principle of simplification and reduction. This hexagram teaches that loss and letting go can be a positive force when accepted willingly. The image shows the mountain above the lake - the mountain diminishes as its waters flow down to nourish the lake below. In traditional interpretation, decrease is not viewed as misfortune but as the necessary counterpart to increase, part of the eternal rhythm of expansion and contraction. The judgment counsels sincerity in times of decrease: when we voluntarily simplify and let go of excess, we create space for what truly matters. This hexagram often appears when we must sacrifice something of lesser importance to gain something of greater value. In divination, it suggests that now is a time to reduce, simplify, and focus on essentials. Release what no longer serves you, and you will discover unexpected benefits. True decrease done with proper spirit leads ultimately to increase.`,
  [42]: `Increase (Yi) embodies the principle of expansion, growth, and enhancement. The image shows wind and thunder - two energies that amplify and strengthen each other. This hexagram depicts the time when what is above decreases itself to increase what is below, a generous movement of benefit flowing downward. In the natural cycle, increase follows decrease, and here we see fortune, growth, and opportunity expanding. The judgment declares this a favorable time for undertakings and movement forward. When Increase appears, it signals that conditions are ripe for development and that others may offer help. The wise person uses times of increase to improve themselves and benefit others, recognizing that true increase comes from sharing abundance rather than hoarding it. In divination, this hexagram encourages you to act on opportunities, accept help when offered, and use your growing resources to benefit others. However, remember that increase has its season - use this time of plenty wisely, as all things in nature eventually turn to their opposite.`,
  [43]: `Breakthrough (Guai) represents the decisive moment when accumulated force breaks through resistance. The image shows the lake risen up to heaven - five strong yang lines push upward against a single yin line at the top, like water ready to overflow. This hexagram embodies resolution, determination, and the culmination of power. The judgment teaches that breakthrough must be proclaimed at the court of the king - meaning that when confronting inferior forces, we must do so openly and with moral authority, never through cunning or violence. Breakthrough comes when we have gathered sufficient strength and now must act decisively but righteously. The danger lies in overconfidence or harsh methods; even when in a superior position, we must remain conscious of ethical conduct. In divination, this hexagram indicates a time when you have the power to overcome obstacles, but warns you to act with integrity and avoid ruthless suppression. Speak truth to power, eliminate what is harmful, but do so through proper channels and with awareness of your own potential for excess.`,
  [44]: `Coming to Meet (Gou) describes an unexpected encounter with something rising from below. The image shows wind beneath heaven, spreading everywhere like the influence of a subtle but pervasive force. In this hexagram, one yin line enters from below among five yang lines, representing the return of dark, receptive energy. While this can suggest seduction or temptation, it also represents necessary meetings and the power of the feminine principle. The judgment warns us to be mindful when meeting what comes unbidden - some encounters should be recognized but not pursued. Coming to Meet teaches discrimination: not every encounter should be embraced, and not every opportunity should be grasped. It can indicate meeting someone or something that seems insignificant but carries hidden influence. In divination, this hexagram counsels awareness and restraint. Be conscious of what you're attracting and what approaches you. Some meetings are fated and beneficial; others may lead you astray. The key is to remain firm in your principles while remaining open to genuine connection.`,
  [45]: `Gathering Together (Cui) represents the assembling of people and resources around a common center. The image shows the lake above the earth, where water collects in one place, nourishing all who gather there. This hexagram depicts unity, congregation, and the power that emerges when people come together with shared purpose. The judgment emphasizes the importance of having a central organizing principle - the king approaching his temple - meaning that successful gathering requires a unifying ideal or leader. When people assemble, conflicts and misunderstandings can arise, so conscious effort toward harmony is essential. Gathering Together suggests making sacrifices to establish common ground and creating structures that support unity. In divination, this hexagram indicates a time for collaboration, community, and bringing people together. It may suggest attending gatherings, joining groups, or organizing collective efforts. Success comes through creating clear focal points that unite diverse elements. However, ensure that what brings people together is worthy and that the gathering serves a higher purpose beyond mere convenience.`,
  [46]: `Pushing Upward (Sheng) embodies the image of organic growth rising from within the earth. Like a tree growing from seed to great height, or a foundation being built from the ground up, this hexagram represents patient, persistent advancement. The image shows wood growing within the earth - invisible effort that will eventually break through to the light. The judgment promises success through seeking out those who can guide you, emphasizing that upward movement is achieved not through force but through natural development and the help of mentors. This is not sudden breakthrough but steady ascent, the kind of progress that comes from consistent effort and proper timing. Pushing Upward suggests working from the bottom up, building on solid foundations, and trusting in gradual advancement. In divination, this hexagram encourages patient cultivation of your goals. Success will come through persistence, learning from those with experience, and allowing natural development to take its course. Do not rush or force progress; instead, put in consistent effort and trust that what is planted will grow in due time.`,
  [47]: `Oppression (Kun) depicts a time of exhaustion and adversity, when external pressures seem overwhelming. The image shows the lake drained by the earth below it - water has sunk down, leaving the lake empty and the well dry. This hexagram represents being hemmed in, restricted, and depleted of resources. Yet the judgment offers profound wisdom: despite adversity, the superior person finds success through maintaining inner truth and perseverance. Words are not believed during times of oppression, but character remains constant. Oppression tests our essential nature and reveals what we are made of when stripped of external supports. This is not a time for action but for maintaining inner composure and trusting in one's principles. The situation may feel desperate, but it is temporary. In divination, this hexagram acknowledges difficult circumstances while counseling acceptance and inner strength. Do not waste energy on complaints or explanations that will not be heard. Instead, conserve your resources, maintain your integrity, and wait for the situation to change. Oppression contains the seeds of liberation.`,
  [48]: `The Well (Jing) symbolizes the unchanging source of nourishment that serves all who come to it. Unlike a stream that flows away, the well remains in one place, offering its water generation after generation. The image shows water above wood - the wooden bucket that draws water upward from the depths. This hexagram represents fundamental resources, social structures, and the sources of spiritual and material sustenance that remain constant while governments and leaders change. The judgment teaches that towns may be relocated, but the well remains the well - it can neither be decreased nor increased, and it simply is what it is. The well serves all without discrimination, asking only that we bring the proper means to draw from it. In divination, The Well indicates reliable resources and enduring value. It suggests looking to established sources of wisdom, maintaining community infrastructure, and ensuring that fundamental needs are met. Success comes through accessing what is already available rather than seeking something new. Examine whether your "bucket" is sound enough to draw up what you need.`,

export const changingLineDescriptions_41_48: Record<HexagramDefinition['number'], string[]> = {
  [41]: [
    `Line 1: Going quickly after completing your own work to help others brings no blame. Consider carefully how much decrease is appropriate - less may be better than more in this situation. When you simplify your own affairs swiftly and use your freed resources to assist others, you act in harmony with the spirit of decrease. This line emphasizes that true decrease often means redirecting rather than merely eliminating. The key is speed and service: move decisively to complete your own necessary reductions, then immediately turn your attention and resources toward those who need support. There is honor in voluntary simplification when it serves a greater good.`,
    `Line 2: Perseverance brings good fortune, but undertaking something brings misfortune. It does not further one to decrease this person. This line indicates a situation where you must maintain your current position without decreasing further. Some things should not be diminished, and forcing reduction where it is inappropriate leads to harm. Sometimes the wisdom of decrease lies in recognizing what must be preserved. Remain steadfast in supporting what is truly valuable, even when the general tendency is toward reduction. The person or thing represented here serves an essential function - to weaken it further would undermine the entire structure. Know the difference between excess that should be cut away and essence that must be maintained.`,
    `Line 3: When three people journey together, their number decreases by one; when one person journeys alone, they find their companion. This line teaches that decrease can paradoxically lead to increase through focus and right relationship. Too many participants create confusion and conflict, causing loss through discord. A solitary, focused effort attracts the right partnership naturally. In practical terms, this suggests that reducing complexity in relationships or projects leads to more authentic and effective connections. Clear away superficial associations to make room for deep, genuine partnership. The authentic relationship emerges when we stop trying to maintain unnecessary connections.`,
    `Line 4: If someone decreases their faults, it makes the other hasten to rejoice. No blame. This line addresses personal transformation and the ripple effects of self-improvement. When you reduce your own negative tendencies and errors, others naturally respond with happiness and support. The decrease that matters most may be the elimination of your own problematic patterns rather than reduction in external circumstances. This brings no blame because it is the most legitimate form of decrease - removing what actually causes problems. Others will eagerly support and respond to your genuine self-improvement, creating a positive cycle. Focus your efforts on decreasing what is genuinely harmful in your own character and actions.`,
    `Line 5: Someone increases you with ten pairs of tortoise shells - you cannot resist. Supreme good fortune. This line marks a reversal where decrease transforms into unexpected increase. The ten pairs of tortoise shells represent gifts of great value, tools for divination and wisdom that cannot be refused. After sincere engagement with decrease, you receive increase from unexpected sources, suggesting that the universe rewards those who willingly simplify and let go. This is supreme good fortune because it comes without striving, as a natural response to your alignment with the principle of decrease. When you have genuinely decreased yourself of excess and ego, valuable gifts and opportunities arrive that you must accept. This is the turning point where decrease ripens into increase.`,
    `Line 6: Increase without decrease brings no blame. Nothing that does not further. In this position, decrease is complete, and pure increase begins. The time for reduction has passed; now is the moment to expand and enhance without restriction. This line indicates that when you have successfully completed the process of decrease, you can move forward with confidence, knowing that further reduction would be counterproductive. The lesson is that decrease has its season and its completion. Once you have simplified to essentials and released what does not serve, the next phase is growth and development. Everything now furthers - all efforts at expansion and enhancement meet with success because they build on a purified foundation.`,
  ],
  [42]: [
    `Line 1: It furthers one to accomplish great deeds. Supreme good fortune. No blame. This line indicates a particularly auspicious beginning during a time of increase. Energy is abundant and available for significant undertakings. When increase first arrives, seize the opportunity to accomplish something substantial and meaningful. The supreme good fortune comes from recognizing this favorable moment and acting decisively to achieve important goals. This is not the time for timidity or small thinking - the conditions support ambitious endeavors. Your actions bring no blame because they align with the natural flow of increasing energy. Use this windfall wisely to create lasting value and benefit.`,
    `Line 2: Someone truly increases you - ten pairs of tortoise shells cannot oppose this. Perseverance in the face of constant good fortune. The king presents offerings before the supreme deity. Good fortune. Here we see increase coming from above, from sources of authority or spiritual power, in a way that cannot be refused or resisted. Like receiving sacred gifts, this increase carries with it both blessing and responsibility. The image of the king making offerings reminds us that even in times of great increase, we must maintain proper reverence and gratitude. Good fortune flows from recognizing that increase is a gift requiring thankful acknowledgment. Your perseverance during this fortunate time means maintaining humility and appropriate response to blessings received. Share your good fortune through appropriate offerings and acknowledgments.`,
    `Line 3: One is increased through unfortunate events. No blame, if you are sincere and walk in the middle, reporting to the prince with your seal. This challenging line shows that increase can come even through difficulties and setbacks. Sometimes adversity forces growth, development, and the discovery of inner resources. The key is sincerity and balance - maintaining integrity and staying centered even when increased by events that appear unfortunate. If you remain authentic and act with proper authority and responsibility (reporting with your seal), what seemed like misfortune becomes the catalyst for genuine advancement. This line teaches that character can be increased through trial, and that difficulties sometimes bring growth that prosperity cannot provide.`,
    `Line 4: If you walk in the middle and report to the prince, he will follow you. It furthers one to be used in the relocation of the capital. This line indicates a position of significant influence during times of increase. Your balanced, centered approach attracts the attention and trust of those in authority. The mention of relocating the capital suggests involvement in major transformative projects - endeavors that reshape fundamental structures. You are well-positioned to serve as an advisor or implementer of important changes. The increase here involves not just personal benefit but the opportunity to contribute to significant social or organizational transformation. Your steadiness and middle way make you valuable for serious undertakings.`,
    `Line 5: If in truth you have a kind heart, do not question it. Supreme good fortune. Your sincerity will be recognized as a kindness that brings blessing. This line speaks to the power of genuine benevolence during times of increase. When you possess resources and influence, approaching others with authentic kindness creates extraordinary good fortune. Don't second-guess your generous impulses or question whether to help others - your sincere good heart is the source of supreme blessing. The kindness you show will be recognized and will generate positive returns. This is increase at its highest level: using abundance to benefit others from a place of authentic compassion. Trust your kind heart without doubt.`,
    `Line 6: No one increases you. Someone even strikes you. One's heart is not constant. Misfortune. This line warns of the reversal that comes when increase reaches its extreme. At the peak of fortune, you may become arrogant, inconsistent, or unreliable, causing others to turn against you rather than support you. The heart that is "not constant" has lost its center due to too much success, becoming changeable and unreliable. This attracts opposition rather than increase - even to the point of being struck or attacked. Misfortune comes from failing to maintain humility and steadiness during times of prosperity. When increase goes to your head, causing you to lose your principles and consistency, you transform blessing into curse. This line counsels maintaining constant character regardless of fortune.`,

    `Line 1: Powerful in the forward-striding toes. When one goes and is not equal to the task, one makes a mistake. This line warns against premature action when facing a breakthrough moment. Like toes that push forward but lack the support of the whole body, advancing before you are truly prepared leads to mistakes. You may feel the power of the coming breakthrough and be eager to act, but if you proceed before fully ready, you will not be equal to the challenge. Restraint at this stage is crucial - gather your full strength before making your move. Partial readiness or isolated strength is insufficient for true breakthrough. Wait until your entire being is aligned and prepared.`,
    `Line 2: A cry of alarm. Arms at evening and at night. Fear nothing. This line depicts vigilance during a tense period before breakthrough. You must remain alert, prepared for action at any time, yet without succumbing to fear. The cry of alarm and readiness with weapons suggests that danger is present, but maintaining calm watchfulness is essential. This is breakthrough in its defensive phase - you must be prepared to act decisively if challenged, but paranoia and excessive anxiety are counterproductive. Balance alertness with confidence. Stay ready without becoming paralyzed by fear. Your preparedness itself provides protection.`,
    `Line 3: To be powerful in the cheekbones brings misfortune. The superior person is firmly resolved. He walks alone and encounters rain. He is bespattered, and people murmur against him. No blame. This line shows the loneliness and difficulty of taking a principled stand when breakthrough requires it. Being "powerful in the cheekbones" suggests aggressive posturing that invites misfortune. Instead, the wise person maintains firm inner resolve while accepting that their solitary path will attract criticism and discomfort. Walking alone through rain, getting dirty while others complain - these are the temporary prices of moral courage during breakthrough. Despite the murmuring and discomfort, you incur no blame because your action is correct. Breakthrough sometimes requires accepting temporary alienation for the sake of what is right.`,
    `Line 4: There is no skin on the thighs, and walking comes hard. If you let yourself be led like a sheep, remorse disappears. But if you hear these words, you will not believe them. This line indicates a difficult position where you have already suffered injury in the process of breakthrough, making further progress painful. The skinless thighs suggest previous battles have left you wounded. The counsel to "be led like a sheep" means accepting guidance and assistance rather than stubbornly insisting on your own way. However, the line acknowledges that you probably won't take this advice - your strong will and independence make it hard to accept help. If you could subordinate your ego and accept guidance, your regrets would vanish. But pride makes this difficult. Consider whether your determination to push through alone might be counterproductive.`,
    `Line 5: In dealing with weeds, firm resolution is necessary. Walking in the middle remains free of blame. This line addresses the need for decisive action in eliminating what is harmful, while maintaining balance and propriety. Like pulling weeds, some things must be removed firmly and completely - half-measures won't work. However, even this forceful action must be undertaken with measured judgment and fairness (walking in the middle). You can be resolute in confronting problems while remaining ethically centered. Breakthrough requires the determination to remove obstacles entirely, but this must be done through proper means and with right intention. Firm resolution combined with balanced judgment brings success without blame.`,
    `Line 6: No cry. In the end, misfortune comes. This line warns of the danger at the extreme of breakthrough. When you have pushed through resistance and achieved victory, there may be a temptation to declare triumph prematurely or become complacent. "No cry" suggests either exhaustion after the struggle or overconfidence that you need not remain vigilant. However, at the very moment of apparent success, new dangers may arise. The line counsels that breakthrough is never completely final - remain alert even after apparent victory. Complacency or assumption that the battle is fully won brings misfortune. Even in success, maintain awareness and readiness.`,

  [44]: [
    `Line 1: It must be checked with a brake of bronze. Perseverance brings good fortune. If you let it take its course, you experience misfortune. Even a lean pig has the strength to rage around. This line warns about the need for strong restraint when encountering something potentially problematic. Like a bronze brake that stops momentum, you must apply firm control at the very first meeting or opportunity. What seems weak or insignificant now (the lean pig) has the potential to cause chaos if allowed to develop unchecked. Perseverance in maintaining boundaries and control brings good fortune, while letting things proceed naturally leads to misfortune. This is about early intervention and firm boundaries - stopping problematic patterns before they gain strength. Don't underestimate small beginnings of negative influences.`,
    `Line 2: There is a fish in the enclosed space. No blame. Does not further guests. This line suggests containing or limiting something that has come to you. The fish in the enclosed space represents something kept under control - not allowed free range but not destroyed either. When something approaches you unbidden, you need not reject it entirely but should keep it bounded and limited. The line warns against sharing this "fish" with guests - not everything you encounter should be offered to others or allowed to influence your wider circle. This is appropriate discretion: acknowledging what comes to meet you while maintaining careful boundaries about its influence. No blame attaches to this restrained approach.`,
    `Line 3: There is no skin on the thighs, and walking comes hard. If one is mindful of the danger, no great mistake is made. This line indicates that you are in a vulnerable position when something comes to meet you, making it difficult to proceed confidently. Like walking on injured thighs, your progress is compromised, and you lack a firm foundation for response. However, awareness of your vulnerable state prevents serious error. Don't pretend strength you don't possess or make commitments you can't honor. Your recognition of danger and limitation protects you from great mistakes. Sometimes the wisest response to an encounter is acknowledgment of your own weakness and proceeding with extreme caution. Awareness of vulnerability is itself a form of protection.`,
    `Line 4: No fish in the enclosed space. This leads to misfortune. Here the fish (opportunity, encounter, or influence) that should be contained has escaped or was never captured. This represents a missed opportunity or failure to properly receive and contain what came to meet you. Misfortune results from this absence - something that should have been secured and bounded was lost or neglected. This line suggests that you may have been too restrictive, too late in responding, or too dismissive of what approached you. The balance in Coming to Meet lies between over-welcoming and complete rejection - here you erred on the side of not engaging at all when some measured response was appropriate. The absence of what could have been valuable leads to regret.`,
    `Line 5: A melon covered with willow leaves. Hidden lines. Then it drops down from heaven. This line presents a beautiful image of something valuable protected and hidden, waiting for the right moment to reveal itself. The melon wrapped in willow leaves represents potential carefully concealed, not displayed prematurely. "Hidden lines" suggests patterns of destiny working beneath the surface. When the time is right, what was hidden drops down from heaven - arrives as if by fate or divine providence. This line counsels patient waiting while maintaining protective covering around something precious. The right encounter or opportunity will reveal itself in due time, seemingly by grace. Don't force premature revelation or meeting; trust that what is meant to come will appear at the proper moment, and it will seem as inevitable as something falling from heaven.`,
    `Line 6: He comes to meet with his horns. Humiliation. No blame. This line depicts meeting others or opportunities with an aggressive, defensive posture - leading with your horns like a bull. While this approach brings humiliation and is clearly not graceful or effective, it carries no blame because it stems from sincere conviction and the desire to maintain your principles. Sometimes when things come to meet you, you must respond with firmness even at the cost of appearing ungracious. The humiliation is temporary and preferable to compromising your values. This line acknowledges that some encounters should be met with resolute resistance, and while this may look awkward or harsh, it is sometimes the correct response. Better to appear stubborn than to be led astray.`,
  ],
  [45]: [
    `Line 1: If you are sincere, but not to the end, there will be sometimes confusion, sometimes gathering together. If you call out, then after one grasp of the hand you can laugh again. Regret disappears. Do not worry. Going is without blame. This line addresses the uncertainty and incomplete commitment that can characterize the beginning of gathering. Your sincerity wavers, leading to alternating states of confusion and unity. The remedy is to reach out, make contact, and seek connection - even one simple gesture like a handshake can restore confidence and joy. Don't agonize over imperfect unity; instead, take simple action to reconnect. Initial awkwardness or doubt about gathering is natural and disappears with sincere reaching out. Move forward without worry - your efforts to gather together bring no blame even if you feel uncertain.`,
    `Line 2: Letting yourself be drawn brings good fortune and remains blameless. If you are sincere, it furthers one to undertake even small offerings. This line emphasizes receptivity during times of gathering. Allow yourself to be drawn toward the center of gathering rather than forcing your position. There is good fortune in yielding to the natural pull of unity. Your sincerity makes even small contributions significant and valuable. You need not offer grand gestures; genuine, modest offerings advance the cause of gathering effectively. This is the wisdom of not striving to be central but allowing yourself to be naturally included. Trust the pull toward unity and contribute what you genuinely can, however modest. Sincere participation matters more than grand gestures.`,
    `Line 3: Gathering together with sighs. Nothing that would further. Going is without blame. A little humiliation. This line depicts the discomfort of being drawn into a gathering where you feel you don't quite belong. There are sighs of awkwardness or resignation - you are included but not enthusiastically or with full compatibility. Nothing in this situation particularly advances your interests, yet leaving would bring slight humiliation. The line suggests accepting this imperfect gathering without blame - sometimes you must participate in assemblies that aren't ideal for you. The discomfort is real but not devastating. Recognize that not all gatherings are meant to further your specific interests, and sometimes participation is more about presence than advantage. Accept the mild awkwardness without taking it too seriously.`,
    `Line 4: Great good fortune. No blame. This line represents a position of significant influence or centrality in the gathering. You may be one who helps organize or anchor the assembly, or you hold a position that naturally draws others. This brings great good fortune and no blame because your role serves the larger purpose of unity. When you help create or maintain the gathering point, you act in harmony with the principle of assembly. Your efforts to bring people together or maintain unity generate considerable blessing. This is a favorable position for leadership in collective endeavors. Trust your role as a gathering point or facilitator.`,
    `Line 5: If there is gathering together at the royal court, this brings no blame. But not all are yet sincerely committed. Only through supreme and enduring perseverance will remorse finally disappear. This line addresses the challenge of maintaining unity when not everyone is fully committed. Gathering around a central authority or purpose (the royal court) is appropriate and brings no blame, but underlying doubts or incomplete loyalty create difficulties. The remedy is sustained, unwavering commitment over time - only supreme perseverance will eventually unite hearts and dissolve remaining reservations. Don't expect immediate wholehearted participation; recognize that building genuine unity requires patient, consistent effort. Your enduring commitment will gradually draw others into sincere participation. Keep faith with the gathering even when others' commitment seems incomplete.`,
    `Line 6: Lamenting and sighing, floods of tears. No blame. This line depicts the sorrow of exclusion or failed gathering. Despite efforts or hopes, you find yourself outside the assembly, or the gathering fails to cohere. The emotional pain is real - expressed through lamenting, sighing, and tears. However, this brings no blame because sometimes gatherings don't work out despite sincere efforts. Not every attempt at unity succeeds, and not every person finds their place in every assembly. The line acknowledges the legitimacy of grief over failed connection while affirming that such outcomes don't represent moral failure. Sometimes the timing is wrong, the fit is poor, or the gathering was never meant to be. Allow yourself to feel the loss without self-blame, knowing that other opportunities for gathering will arise.`,

  [46]: [
    `Line 1: Pushing upward that meets with confidence brings supreme good fortune. This line indicates an auspicious beginning where your efforts to advance are met with trust and support. Those above you or those with resources believe in your potential and facilitate your growth. This meeting of your upward effort with confidence from others creates supreme good fortune. Your advancement is smooth because it is supported and welcomed. This line encourages you to move forward confidently when you sense that others trust in your development. The combination of your genuine effort and others' faith creates ideal conditions for growth. Accept and reciprocate the confidence placed in you.`,
    `Line 2: If one is sincere, it furthers one to bring even a small offering. No blame. This line emphasizes that during upward advancement, sincerity matters more than the magnitude of your offering or effort. Even modest contributions are valuable when offered with genuine intent. You need not possess great resources or make grand gestures to advance - authentic, sincere participation in the upward movement brings success. This is the wisdom of organic growth: genuine small efforts accumulate into significant advancement over time. Don't be discouraged by the apparently small scale of what you can offer. Sincerity and consistency are more important than impressive displays. Your modest but genuine contributions bring no blame and actually further your advancement.`,
    `Line 3: One pushes upward into an empty city. This line suggests advancing into a situation where obstacles have unexpectedly disappeared or where you encounter less resistance than anticipated. The empty city represents opportunity without opposition - you can make progress easily because the way is clear. This could indicate that previous difficulties have resolved themselves, or that you are advancing into territory that is ready to receive you. However, there is also a subtle note of caution: an empty city may suggest lack of vitality or substance. Advance confidently but remain aware that ease of progress doesn't always indicate depth of achievement. Still, this is fundamentally favorable - when the way is clear, move forward.`,
    `Line 4: The king offers sacrifice on Mount Qi. Good fortune. No blame. This line invokes a historical image from ancient China where kings made offerings at sacred mountains to establish legitimacy and divine favor. Your upward advancement has reached a point where it should be acknowledged through appropriate ritual, recognition, or dedication. Making proper offerings to whatever you consider higher authority or sacred principle brings good fortune. This is advancement with humility and proper acknowledgment of what makes growth possible. As you rise, remember to honor the sources of your opportunity and express gratitude appropriately. Your recognition of what supports your advancement brings blessing and continues to clear your path forward.`,
    `Line 5: Perseverance brings good fortune. One pushes upward by steps. This line captures the essence of Pushing Upward - steady, gradual advancement through consistent effort and perseverance. Like climbing stairs, you make progress step by step, each stage building on the previous one. This is not dramatic breakthrough but patient, sustained ascent. The good fortune comes from maintaining your steady effort without rushing or forcing premature results. Trust in incremental progress and natural development. Each step upward is a foundation for the next. This line affirms that your approach is correct - keep moving forward steadily, maintaining your perseverance, and trust that each step leads naturally to the next. Gradual advancement is sustainable advancement.`,
    `Line 6: Pushing upward in darkness. It furthers one to be unremittingly persevering. This line depicts advancement in difficult or unclear circumstances - pushing upward without full visibility or clear guidance. Despite the darkness or uncertainty, continued perseverance brings benefit. This suggests that near the culmination of upward movement, the path may become less clear or more challenging. You must maintain your effort even when you can't see exactly where you're going or when progress seems invisible. Trust in the direction you've established and continue moving forward despite darkness or uncertainty. Unremitting perseverance means maintaining your effort without pause or doubt, even when external confirmation is lacking. The darkness is temporary, and your persistent upward effort will eventually break through to clarity. Don't stop pushing upward just because the way becomes obscure.`,

  [47]: [
    `Line 1: One sits oppressed under a bare tree in a gloomy valley. For three years one sees nothing. This line depicts the depth and duration of oppression at its beginning. Sitting under a bare tree (without shelter or nourishment) in a gloomy valley (surrounded by darkness) suggests complete desolation. The three years indicate extended duration - this is not quickly resolved. "Seeing nothing" means lacking any vision of improvement or way forward. This line acknowledges the reality of severe, prolonged hardship. The counsel is endurance and acceptance that some periods of oppression are both deep and lengthy. Don't expect quick relief or easy solutions. Preserve your core being through the extended difficulty, knowing that even three years eventually pass.`,
    `Line 2: One is oppressed while at meat and drink. The person with the scarlet knee bands comes. It furthers one to offer sacrifice. To set forth brings misfortune. No blame. This line presents a peculiar situation: oppression exists even while basic needs are met (meat and drink are available). The appearance of someone with scarlet knee bands suggests official help or formal recognition is approaching. However, the counsel is not to act but to make offerings and wait. Setting forth (taking action) brings misfortune even though the situation seems to call for movement. This line teaches that some forms of oppression cannot be addressed through direct action; instead, spiritual or ritual response (offering sacrifice) is appropriate. Wait for help to arrive rather than forcing action. Despite apparent inaction, you incur no blame because action would be counterproductive. Sometimes waiting with proper attitude is the correct response to oppression.`,
    `Line 3: One is oppressed by stone and leans on thorns and thistles. One enters the house and does not see one's wife. Misfortune. This line depicts compounding difficulties: oppressed by something heavy and unyielding (stone) while finding only painful support (thorns and thistles). Even returning home offers no comfort - your wife is absent, suggesting that normal sources of support and comfort have vanished. This represents misfortune where multiple levels of oppression converge, and nowhere feels safe or supportive. The line acknowledges this as genuine misfortune without offering false consolation. When oppression reaches this level, recognize the severity of your situation without self-deception. This depth of difficulty requires profound acceptance and the understanding that some periods of life are simply deeply hard.`,
    `Line 4: He comes very quietly, oppressed in a golden carriage. Humiliation, but the end is reached. This line presents an interesting reversal: someone who should be powerful (riding in a golden carriage) comes quietly and is actually oppressed despite appearances of status. The golden carriage represents external status that doesn't match internal reality - perhaps wealth without freedom, or position without power. There is humiliation in this contradiction between appearance and reality. However, "the end is reached" suggests that this state of oppression is approaching its conclusion. Sometimes we must endure the awkwardness of appearing privileged while feeling oppressed. The humiliation is temporary, and recognizing that the end is near provides some consolation. This line counsels patience during the final phase of oppression when external appearances don't match internal experience.`,
    `Line 5: His nose and feet are cut off. Oppression at the hands of the person with purple knee bands. Joy comes slowly. It furthers one to make offerings and libations. This line depicts serious injury or mutilation (nose and feet cut off) at the hands of authority (purple knee bands indicate high rank). This is oppression by those in power, causing real damage. However, the line promises that joy comes slowly - eventual relief and recovery are possible despite current severity. The counsel to make offerings and libations suggests that spiritual practice and proper ritual response aid recovery. This line acknowledges traumatic oppression while holding hope for eventual healing. Joy comes slowly emphasizes that recovery cannot be rushed - deep wounds require extended time to heal. Maintain spiritual practice and trust that the slow movement toward joy is occurring even when not yet visible.`,
    `Line 6: He is oppressed by creeping vines. He moves uneasily and says, "Movement brings remorse." If one feels remorse and sets forth, good fortune comes. This line depicts the final stage of oppression, where you are entangled but the oppression is weakening (creeping vines rather than chains). You feel uncertain and are hesitant to move, fearing that action will bring regret. However, the line teaches that if you acknowledge your hesitation and doubts (feel remorse about your uncertainty) and then act anyway, good fortune comes. This is oppression at the point where it can be overcome through decisive action, but psychological hesitation remains. The counsel is to move through your doubt and act despite lingering fear. The oppression has weakened enough that action is now appropriate and beneficial. Trust that movement forward, even with reservation, leads to good fortune.`,

    `Line 1: A well so muddy that one cannot drink from it. An old well to which no animals come. This line depicts a well in such poor condition that it serves no function. The muddy water is undrinkable, and even animals avoid it. This represents resources, knowledge, or social structures that have fallen into such neglect or corruption that they no longer serve their purpose. When a well reaches this state, it is essentially useless despite being a well. This line suggests examining whether what should be a reliable source (your own resources, community structures, or knowledge base) has become so neglected or contaminated that it no longer functions properly. The answer may be that fundamental renovation is needed. A well in this condition serves no one and attracts no one. This is a call to recognize when essential resources have degraded below the point of usefulness.`,
    `Line 2: At the wellhole, one shoots fishes. The jug is broken and leaks. This line shows misuse and deterioration of the well. Shooting fish in the wellhole suggests using a vital resource for trivial purposes or in inappropriate ways. The broken, leaking jug means that even if you draw water, it cannot be retained or used effectively. This represents a situation where fundamental resources exist but are being misused or where the means to utilize them are damaged. Your "bucket" or method of accessing what is available is broken. This line calls attention to how you are using (or misusing) available resources and whether your means of accessing them are sound. Repair your vessel before trying to draw from the well. Don't waste essential resources on trivial pursuits.`,
    `Line 3: The well is cleaned, but no one drinks from it. This is my heart's sorrow, for one might draw from it. If the king were clear-minded, good fortune might be enjoyed in common. This line depicts a tragic situation: the well is in good condition and ready to serve, but no one comes to draw from it. This could represent your own talents, wisdom, or offerings that go unused and unrecognized. The speaker expresses sorrow at this waste - the resource is ready but remains unused. The reference to the king suggests that recognition from authority or leadership could change this situation, allowing the good fortune to be shared. This line speaks to the frustration of having value to offer that goes unrecognized or unused. The counsel is patience - the well simply remains ready and maintains its purity, trusting that eventually someone will recognize its worth and draw from it. Continue maintaining your readiness even when unacknowledged.`,
    `Line 4: The well is being lined. No blame. This line depicts necessary maintenance and improvement of the well. Lining the well with stone or brick is important work that temporarily makes the well unusable but improves its long-term function. This brings no blame even though the well cannot be used during repairs. Sometimes essential structures, resources, or knowledge bases need renovation and improvement. The temporary inconvenience or unavailability is acceptable because the work serves long-term functionality. This line suggests that you may be in a period of necessary renovation or restructuring. Don't feel guilty about being temporarily unavailable or about time spent on fundamental improvements. The work you are doing to improve basic structures or capacities is valuable and necessary. Proper maintenance brings no blame even when it temporarily reduces service or availability.`,
    `Line 5: In the well there is a clear, cold spring from which one can drink. This line represents the well functioning at its best - pure, refreshing water freely available to all who come. This is the ideal state where resources are clean, accessible, and nourishing. If you are the well, you have reached a state where you can genuinely serve others from a place of purity and depth. If you seek the well, you have found a genuine source of nourishment and wisdom. This line indicates that fundamental resources are in excellent condition and serving their proper function. The clear, cold spring represents quality that cannot be denied or doubted - what is offered is genuinely valuable. When you encounter or embody this level of purity and accessibility, recognize it as the realization of the well's true purpose. Good fortune flows naturally from such genuine, refreshing sources.`,
    `Line 6: One draws from the well without hindrance. It is dependable. Supreme good fortune. This line represents complete success in both maintaining and accessing the well. Drawing without hindrance means free access to resources, and dependability means the well consistently provides what is needed. This is supreme good fortune because it represents sustainable, reliable access to essential nourishment - physical, mental, or spiritual. The well has been properly maintained, the means of drawing are sound, and access is unimpeded. This line suggests either that you have successfully created or maintained reliable resources, or that you have found such a source and can depend on it. Supreme good fortune comes from the reliability and accessibility of essential nourishment. The well at this stage fulfills its highest purpose: serving all who come to it, consistently and without limitation. This is the achievement of genuine sustainability and shared benefit.`,
