  [33]: `Retreat (Dun) represents the wisdom of strategic withdrawal and preservation of strength. Like the mountain rising beneath heaven, this hexagram teaches that there are times when withdrawing is not weakness but profound wisdom. The judgment counsels that retreat brings success when darkness grows and the time for advancing has passed. This is not about defeat or running away in fear, but about recognizing the natural rhythms of advance and withdrawal that govern all aspects of life. The ancient sages understood that knowing when to retreat is as important as knowing when to advance. In divination, this hexagram often appears when circumstances are not favorable for direct action, suggesting that you preserve your energy and position for a more opportune moment. The key is to retreat with dignity and purpose, maintaining your principles while avoiding unnecessary conflict. This is the retreat of the wise person who understands timing and can distinguish between cowardice and strategic wisdom.`,
  [34]: `Great Power (Da Zhuang) signifies the peak of strength and vitality, when yang energy reaches its zenith. Thunder in heaven above creates a time of tremendous force and momentum. The judgment promises that perseverance in what is right brings good fortune, but this hexagram also carries a warning: great power must be wielded with wisdom and restraint. Like a ram butting against a fence, unbridled strength can lead to entanglement and difficulty. The traditional interpretation emphasizes that true greatness lies not in the mere possession of power, but in its proper and measured application. This hexagram appears when you have considerable resources, energy, or influence at your disposal. The challenge is to use this power righteously and avoid the temptation of arrogance or aggression. Power used in service of what is correct and beneficial brings lasting success, while power used recklessly or selfishly leads to complications. Consider carefully how you direct your considerable strength during this time.`,
  [35]: `Progress (Jin) depicts the sun rising over the earth, bringing light, clarity, and natural advancement. This hexagram embodies a time of rapid development and recognition, when your efforts gain visibility and support from those in positions of authority. The judgment speaks of a powerful prince who receives horses in great numbers and is received in audience three times in a single day. This imagery conveys abundant opportunity and favor from above. Progress here is not forced or contrived but flows naturally from the rightness of your position and actions. In divination, this hexagram indicates a time of favorable conditions where advancement comes easily and naturally. Your work gains recognition, your talents are appreciated, and doors open before you. The key is to accept this progress gracefully while maintaining your integrity and continuing to work diligently. This is not a time for doubt or hesitation, but for confident forward movement while remaining humble and true to your principles.`,
  [36]: `Darkening of the Light (Ming Yi) represents a time when enlightenment must be hidden, when the light descends beneath the earth. This challenging hexagram depicts circumstances where intelligence and virtue must be concealed to survive in times of darkness and oppression. The traditional text tells of King Wen, who maintained his inner light and principles even while imprisoned by a tyrant. The judgment counsels perseverance in adversity, suggesting that by maintaining your inner truth while appearing outwardly compliant, you can endure difficult times. This is not about compromise of principles but about strategic discretion. In divination, this hexagram often appears during periods of injustice, misunderstanding, or when dealing with unreasonable authorities or circumstances. The wise response is not to fight openly against overwhelming opposition but to preserve your inner light while waiting for conditions to improve. Hide your brightness, be cautious in your words and actions, yet never lose sight of your true nature and values. Like a lamp kept burning through the darkest night, your inner truth will eventually shine forth when the time is right.`,
  [37]: `The Family (Jia Ren) addresses the fundamental importance of proper relationships within the household and by extension, within any organized group. Wind emerging from fire symbolizes the proper influence that flows from correct internal structure and relationships. The judgment emphasizes that the perseverance of the woman brings good fortune, highlighting the importance of each person fulfilling their proper role with dedication and integrity. This hexagram teaches that a well-ordered family or organization serves as the foundation for all greater achievements in society. The relationships within the family sphere are seen as a microcosm of all human relationships, where loyalty, responsibility, and mutual respect create harmony. In divination, this hexagram directs attention to your closest relationships and immediate circle. Success in larger endeavors depends on harmony in your foundational relationships. Consider how you maintain boundaries, fulfill your responsibilities, and nurture those closest to you. The hexagram suggests that by cultivating proper conduct and sincerity in your immediate sphere, you create the conditions for broader success and harmony.`,
  [38]: `Opposition (Kui) represents a time of divergence, misunderstanding, and estrangement when natural affinities seem to separate. Fire moving upward and water flowing downward symbolize forces moving in opposite directions. Yet the judgment counsels that in small matters, good fortune can still be found. This hexagram teaches that opposition and difference are natural aspects of life, and that unity in all things is neither possible nor necessarily desirable. The key is to recognize which oppositions are insurmountable and which can be bridged through patience and understanding. In divination, this hexagram often appears when you face conflicts, misunderstandings, or when you feel alienated from others. The message is not to force agreement where fundamental differences exist, but to find areas of small cooperation and mutual benefit. Sometimes opposition helps clarify your own position and values. When you cannot change the fundamental situation, focus on maintaining your integrity and finding common ground in minor matters. Even in times of separation and difference, respectful distance and small courtesies can prevent complete alienation and may prepare the ground for future reconciliation.`,
  [39]: `Obstruction (Jian) depicts dangerous waters ahead of the mountain, representing obstacles that block the path forward. This hexagram counsels that attempting to push forward brings misfortune, while turning back to regroup and seek help leads to good fortune. The traditional image is of a dangerous mountain pass with treacherous waters, a situation requiring careful consideration rather than bold advance. The judgment teaches that sometimes the way forward is to first step back, to seek counsel and assistance, and to gather strength before attempting to overcome difficulties. In divination, this hexagram indicates that you face genuine obstacles that cannot be overcome through will alone. This is not a time for solitary heroism but for seeking guidance from those with experience and wisdom. The obstruction may be external circumstances, or it may reflect your own limitations that need to be addressed. By acknowledging the difficulty, retreating temporarily, and seeking support, you position yourself to eventually overcome the obstacle. The key wisdom is recognizing when persistence becomes stubbornness, and when seeking help is the truly courageous path.`,
  [40]: `Deliverance (Jie) represents the breakthrough after difficulty, the release of tension, and the resolution of obstacles. Thunder and rain symbolize the sudden clearing of atmospheric pressure, bringing relief and liberation. The judgment counsels that if there is nothing more to be done, return brings good fortune; if there is still work to do, hastening brings good fortune. This hexagram marks the moment when complications dissolve and normal conditions are restored. However, it carries an important warning: after deliverance, do not linger in the moment of relief but move forward decisively or return to your center. In divination, this hexagram suggests that a difficult period is ending or has ended. The tension breaks, problems resolve, and you can breathe freely again. Yet the wisdom here is to not become complacent or to celebrate excessively. Use this moment of deliverance to either complete remaining tasks quickly or to return to a state of calm equilibrium. Forgive old grievances, release resentments, and do not dwell on the difficulties that have passed. This is a time for clearing away the remnants of trouble and moving forward with renewed energy and clarity.`,

  [33]: [
    `Line 1 - Retreat at the tail brings danger. The position is already weak, at the very end of the retreat. Those who wait too long to withdraw face increasing peril. This line warns against lingering when retreat is clearly necessary. Do not attempt to make a stand when the time for withdrawal has come - this only exposes you to harm. Take no action; simply hold your position and avoid drawing attention. The danger is not in retreating but in failing to recognize when retreat should have already begun.`,
    `Line 2 - Holding fast with yellow oxhide. This line depicts someone so firmly committed to retreat that nothing can prevent them from withdrawing appropriately. Yellow represents the middle way and inner truth, while oxhide symbolizes unbreakable strength. You maintain your resolve through inner conviction rather than external force. No one can dissuade you from the course you know to be correct. This steadfastness in retreat, based on genuine understanding rather than fear or stubbornness, leads to good fortune.`,
    `Line 3 - Retreat while halted brings illness and danger. This line presents a difficult position - you recognize the need to retreat, but something holds you back. Perhaps attachments, responsibilities, or lingering hopes prevent clean withdrawal. This creates internal conflict and exhaustion. The image suggests being tied down while needing to leave. If you can release whatever binds you, feeding and caring for those few who remain with you, you can find a measure of good fortune. But divided intention brings suffering. Consider what truly prevents your retreat and whether those obligations are as binding as they seem.`,
    `Line 4 - Voluntary retreat brings good fortune to the noble person, downfall to the inferior. This line distinguishes between retreat motivated by wisdom and retreat motivated by self-interest. The superior person withdraws at the appropriate time to preserve principles and strength, finding good fortune in strategic positioning. The inferior person retreats from cowardice or abandonment of duty, bringing ruin upon themselves. When you retreat, examine your motivations. Are you preserving what matters for a better time, or are you simply running from difficulty? The nobility of retreat lies in maintaining your integrity while yielding ground.`,
    `Line 5 - Friendly retreat brings good fortune. This line depicts retreat executed with grace and goodwill, maintaining positive relations even while withdrawing. There is no bitterness, no burning of bridges, no dramatic exit. The timing is perfect - not too early, not too late. You recognize the right moment and act with courtesy and clarity. Others understand and support your withdrawal. This attitude of friendliness and appropriateness brings perseverance and success. Retreat need not be contentious or painful when handled with wisdom and good spirit.`,
    `Line 6 - Flight like a bird brings supreme success. This is the highest position, representing complete freedom in retreat. There is no hesitation, no looking back, no entanglement. Like a bird taking flight, the movement is natural, effortless, and absolutely correct. You have maintained your independence and clarity throughout, so when the time comes to withdraw, you simply do so without complications. Everything furthers because your retreat is completely unobstructed. This is the reward for those who never compromised their ability to withdraw freely.`,
  ],
  [34]: [
    `Line 1 - Power in the toes: continuing brings misfortune. This line warns against using power prematurely or from a weak position. The toes represent the lowest position, where power has just begun to gather but is not yet consolidated. If you try to advance or assert yourself now, you will overreach and invite failure. Power at this stage must be held in check, not expressed outwardly. Even if you feel strength rising within, the situation does not support action. Restraint now prevents disaster later.`,
    `Line 2 - Perseverance brings good fortune. This line represents power that is gathering but not yet at its height, combined with a position of centrality and correctness. The strength is real but properly contained. By continuing to build your position carefully and avoiding premature displays of force, you create the foundation for genuine success. This is the patient accumulation of power, growing steadily without attracting opposition. Your restraint is not weakness but wisdom - power is most effective when it does not announce itself too early.`,
    `Line 3 - The inferior person uses power; the superior person does not. A billy goat butts against a hedge and gets his horns entangled. This line depicts the danger of using power without wisdom. The inferior person, feeling strong, immediately seeks to demonstrate that strength, only to become trapped in complications of their own making. The superior person, though equally strong, refrains from display and thus remains free. You may feel an urge to prove your strength or force an outcome, but this will only entangle you in difficulties. True power knows when not to act.`,
    `Line 4 - Perseverance brings good fortune; remorse disappears. The hedge opens, there is no entanglement. Power rests on the axle of a big cart. This line shows power that has learned wisdom through experience. Previous overreaching (implied by the mention of remorse) has taught appropriate use of force. Now power is applied correctly - like the strong axle that supports the cart's motion without calling attention to itself. The obstacles that trapped earlier expressions of force now open naturally. This is power serving a purpose larger than itself, integrated into constructive action. Success comes through power yoked to wisdom.`,
    `Line 5 - Losing the goat with ease. This line counsels the voluntary release of aggressive tendencies. The goat represents the butting, forceful aspect of power that leads to entanglement. By letting go of this aggressive energy easily and without regret, you avoid the complications that come from excessive force. There is no blame in this release because you have recognized that the aggressive expression of power serves no useful purpose. Sometimes the highest use of power is choosing not to wield it. This voluntary restraint brings a kind of success that forcing could never achieve.`,
    `Line 6 - A billy goat butts against a hedge. He can neither go forward nor backward. Nothing serves to further. If you remain aware of the difficulty, this brings good fortune. This line depicts power that has pushed too far and is now completely stuck. Forward movement is blocked, backward movement is impossible due to the horns caught in the hedge. This is the ultimate result of power used without wisdom. However, even this difficult position contains a teaching - if you recognize the trap you are in and understand how you got there, the awareness itself brings a kind of fortune. The situation may not be easily resolved, but consciousness of your predicament prevents you from making it worse and opens the possibility of eventual extrication through patience rather than force.`,

  [35]: [
    `Line 1 - Progressing but turned back. Perseverance brings good fortune. If you do not receive trust, remain calm and without blame. This line depicts the beginning of progress where you meet initial resistance or lack of recognition. Others may not yet acknowledge your advancement or may actively push back. The key is to persevere in doing what is right without becoming agitated or resentful. Your progress is real even if not yet recognized. By maintaining composure and continuing your work, you lay the groundwork for eventual acceptance. Becoming angry or forcing recognition would only create problems. Trust in the rightness of your path and let time prove your worth.`,
    `Line 2 - Progressing but in sorrow. Perseverance brings good fortune. You receive great blessing from your ancestral mother. This line shows progress that comes with pain or sacrifice, perhaps because you must advance alone or without the support you expected. Despite this sadness, the progress itself is genuine and will bring good fortune if you persevere. The mention of blessing from the ancestral mother suggests that your true support comes from deep sources - heritage, principles, or inner strength passed down through generations. Though your immediate situation may be lonely or difficult, you are not without resources. The blessing is real even if invisible.`,
    `Line 3 - All are in accord. Remorse disappears. This line indicates progress that gains universal support. Previous doubts or regrets vanish as your advancement is recognized and welcomed by all around you. There is harmony between your movement forward and the environment you are moving through. This is the turning point where progress becomes easy and natural because you have earned the trust and goodwill of others. Any initial resistance or uncertainty has dissolved. When this line appears, move forward with confidence - the way is open and your progress serves everyone's benefit.`,
    `Line 4 - Progress like a hamster. Perseverance brings danger. This line warns of advancement gained through hoarding or seeking position for selfish advantage rather than genuine merit. The hamster stuffs its cheeks, accumulating resources through greed rather than proper means. If you continue in this manner, even if it seems to work temporarily, danger lies ahead. Progress achieved through questionable means or selfish motivation cannot be sustained. Examine whether your advancement serves a higher purpose or merely feeds personal greed. Redirect your progress toward genuine contribution rather than accumulation, or face eventual downfall.`,
    `Line 5 - Remorse disappears. Take not gain and loss to heart. Undertakings bring good fortune. Everything furthers. This line represents progress from a position of central authority and correctness. You have reached a place where you can advance freely without concern for petty gains or losses. Previous doubts vanish because your position is secure and your intentions are pure. This is progress that benefits all, undertaken without selfish calculation. When you do not cling to outcomes or worry about personal advantage, your actions naturally align with what is beneficial. Everything you undertake succeeds because you have transcended concern for personal gain and loss.`,
    `Line 6 - Progress with the horns. Use this only to punish your own territory. Awareness of danger brings good fortune. No blame if you are conscious of your mistakes. This line depicts progress that has reached its limit and threatens to become aggressive. The horns suggest dangerous force that, if turned outward, would bring conflict and trouble. The only appropriate use of this power is inward - disciplining your own domain, correcting your own errors. You have advanced as far as external progress should go. Recognize the danger of pushing further. Turn your attention to consolidation and self-correction rather than continued expansion. By remaining aware of both your power and its dangers, you maintain good fortune and avoid blame.`,

    `Line 1 - Darkening of the light during flight. The bird lowers its wings. The superior person on the journey goes three days without eating. Yet there is somewhere to go. The host has occasion to gossip. This line depicts flight from oppression, traveling through dangerous territory where sustenance is scarce and reputation is attacked. The journey is necessary but harsh. You must humble yourself (lower your wings) and endure hardship. Others may speak against you, questioning your actions or character. Despite these difficulties, there is indeed somewhere to go - your flight has purpose. Endure the hardship without complaint and without explaining yourself to those who would not understand. The darkness will eventually pass.`,
    `Line 2 - Darkening of the light injures in the left thigh. Give aid with the strength of a horse. Good fortune. This line depicts being wounded while trying to help others in dark times. The left thigh represents the supportive side, the instinct to assist those in trouble. Your impulse to help or rescue causes you to be injured by the oppressive circumstances. Yet if you respond with powerful, sustained effort (the strength of a horse), good fortune can be achieved. This suggests that helping others during dark times requires extraordinary commitment and strength. Half-hearted or inadequate assistance will only increase suffering. If you commit fully to helping, success is possible, but understand the cost and ensure you have the strength to follow through.`,
    `Line 3 - Darkening of the light during the hunt in the south. The great leader is captured. Do not expect perseverance too soon. This line describes encountering the source of darkness and oppression directly. The hunt in the south (the region of light) that results in capture suggests confronting injustice and being overcome by it. Perhaps you challenged authority too directly or underestimated the power aligned against you. Now is not the time to expect that perseverance alone will sustain you. The situation is more severe than that. This is about survival rather than victory. Do not maintain rigid principles that would bring destruction; instead, adapt to circumstances while preserving your essential nature. There will be time later for correction and justice.`,
    `Line 4 - Penetrating the left side of the belly, one obtains the heart of darkening of the light and leaves gate and courtyard. This line depicts deep insight into the nature of the darkness and oppression you face. By penetrating to the heart of the matter, you understand the true source and nature of the problem. This understanding allows you to escape (leave gate and courtyard) even though you are in the midst of dark circumstances. The left side suggests approaching indirectly, finding the hidden truth rather than confronting obvious manifestations. When you truly understand what you are dealing with, you can navigate through or around it. This is the power of insight in dark times - comprehension itself creates a path to freedom.`,
    `Line 5 - The darkening of the light as with Prince Ji. Perseverance furthers. This line refers to Prince Ji, who maintained his principles and pretended madness to survive the tyrant's court. This is the darkest position - in the very center of oppression and injustice - yet maintaining one's inner light through whatever means necessary. You may need to appear compliant, harmless, or even foolish while inwardly remaining true to your values. This requires tremendous discipline and patience. The perseverance mentioned is not outward resistance but inner faithfulness to truth while adapting your outer behavior to survive. This is strategic concealment at its highest level, maintaining your essential self while navigating through extended darkness.`,
    `Line 6 - Not light but darkness. First ascending to heaven, then plunging into the depths of the earth. This line depicts the fall of the oppressor or the oppressive system itself. What appeared to be ascending to heights of power suddenly crashes into darkness and destruction. This is the natural end of rule based on suppressing light and truth. For those who have endured the darkness, this line signals its ending - not through your action but through the inherent instability of oppression. All systems that suppress truth eventually collapse under their own contradictions. If you have maintained your inner light through the dark times, you will survive this dramatic reversal. The darkness that seemed so powerful proves to be its own undoing.`,

  [37]: [
    `Line 1 - Firm seclusion within the family. Remorse disappears. This line emphasizes establishing clear boundaries and order within the household from the beginning. By creating firm structures and expectations early, you prevent the problems that come from vagueness or laxity. The remorse that might arise from later conflicts or disorder disappears because you established proper foundations. In any organization or family, clear agreements about roles, responsibilities, and boundaries prevent future difficulties. This is not harshness but clarity - everyone knows what is expected, and this creates security rather than resentment.`,
    `Line 2 - Following nothing that would deviate. In the center of the house, attending to the food. Perseverance brings good fortune. This line depicts the central, nurturing role within the family or organization. Rather than seeking attention or pursuing personal agenda, you focus on fundamental care - ensuring that all are nourished and sustained. There is no deviation toward dramatic action or self-assertion; instead, steady attention to basic needs. This is the power of the center that sustains all else. By attending faithfully to this essential but unglamorous work, you create the foundation for the household's well-being. Persevering in this nurturing role brings lasting good fortune.`,
    `Line 3 - When tempers flare in the family, repenting severity brings good fortune. When indulgence and laughter go too far, it leads to humiliation. This line addresses the balance between discipline and permissiveness. When conflicts arise (tempers flare), responding with too much severity creates more problems than it solves. Better to regret being too strict and adjust toward understanding. However, the opposite extreme - allowing too much looseness, laughter without limits, indulgence of every whim - leads to loss of respect and eventual chaos. This line teaches that family harmony requires finding the middle way between harshness and laxity, and that it is better to err slightly toward firmness than toward complete permissiveness.`,
    `Line 4 - Enriching the family brings great good fortune. This line represents the provider who ensures the household's prosperity and stability. By fulfilling economic and organizational responsibilities excellently, you create abundance that benefits all members. This is not selfish enrichment but stewardship that serves the whole family or organization. When material and organizational foundations are secure, the family can flourish in all ways. This line praises those who take responsibility for the practical well-being of the household, creating prosperity through diligence and capable management.`,
    `Line 5 - As a king, you approach your family. Fear not. Good fortune. This line depicts the leader who rules their household with natural authority and benevolence. Like a true king, you do not need to enforce obedience through fear or harshness - your authority comes from inner worth and genuine care for those in your charge. The instruction "fear not" suggests confidence in your own rightness and the trust of those you lead. When a leader is sincere and truly serves the family's welfare, their authority is welcomed rather than resented. This is leadership that brings good fortune because it is based on mutual respect and genuine concern rather than domination.`,
    `Line 6 - Your work commands respect. In the end, good fortune comes. This line represents the culmination of proper family leadership and order. Through consistent, sincere effort to create and maintain right relationships, you have earned genuine respect. This is not fear or mere compliance but true regard based on your character and actions. The good fortune that comes "in the end" suggests that the benefits of proper family order may not be immediately obvious but become clear over time. Your work in establishing harmony, fulfilling responsibilities, and maintaining integrity creates lasting positive effects that endure and grow. This is the reward for those who take family and fundamental relationships seriously.`,

  [38]: [
    `Line 1 - Remorse disappears. If you lose your horse, do not run after it; it will come back of its own accord. When you see evil people, guard yourself against mistakes. This line teaches acceptance of apparent loss during times of opposition. What seems to be leaving or lost (the horse) will naturally return if you do not chase desperately after it. The more important counsel concerns guarding yourself when encountering those whose values oppose yours. The goal is not to convert them or engage in conflict but to maintain your own integrity and avoid being pulled into wrong action. During times of opposition, focus on what you can control - your own conduct - rather than trying to force reconciliation or chase what has gone.`,
    `Line 2 - Meeting the master in a narrow street. No blame. This line depicts an unexpected encounter during a time of estrangement. Meeting in a narrow street suggests informal, unavoidable contact rather than planned engagement. Despite the general atmosphere of opposition, this particular meeting is free of blame - both parties conduct themselves appropriately given the circumstances. Sometimes during periods of separation or opposition, accidental encounters can be handled with courtesy and dignity. This line suggests that not all contact during times of opposition needs to be avoided; what matters is maintaining proper conduct when meetings do occur.`,
    `Line 3 - Seeing the wagon dragged back, the ox halted, a man with hair and nose cut off. Not a good beginning but a good end. This line depicts extreme frustration and obstacles. Everything seems to be going wrong - progress is reversed, movement is stopped, and there are signs of disgrace or punishment. The situation appears terrible. However, the line promises that despite this dreadful beginning, the end will be good. Sometimes opposition must reach its extreme before resolution becomes possible. The very severity of the difficulties creates conditions for eventual breakthrough. When you feel that everything is going wrong and opposition is overwhelming, remember that this may be the necessary prelude to positive change. Endure without losing heart.`,
    `Line 4 - Isolated through opposition, you meet like-minded people. Engaging with them brings danger but no blame. Remain aware of the danger and no error will result. This line depicts finding allies during times of isolation and opposition. When estranged from the majority, you discover others who share your values and understanding. While connecting with these like-minded people is necessary and correct, doing so carries risk - you may become a target, or your association may draw opposition. Engage with your true allies but remain conscious of the dangers this creates. Your awareness of risk allows you to navigate the situation without making mistakes. This is not paranoia but appropriate caution while maintaining necessary connections.`,
    `Line 5 - Remorse disappears. Your companion bites through the covering. How could going forward bring blame? This line represents a breakthrough in the midst of opposition. Someone close to you (your companion) breaks through the barriers and false appearances (bites through the covering) that created the opposition. This clearing away of misunderstanding or pretense changes everything. With this breakthrough, the remorse and difficulty of opposition vanish. Now moving forward is completely appropriate and brings no blame. Sometimes opposition is based on misunderstanding or false appearances, and when these are penetrated, natural harmony can be restored. This line signals that moment of clarification that transforms opposition into potential alliance.`,
    `Line 6 - Isolated through opposition, you see your companion as a pig covered in dirt, a wagon full of devils. First you draw the bow against them, then you let it down. They are not robbers but will become in-laws. As you go, rain comes and brings good fortune. This line teaches about the resolution of opposition through understanding. At first, the opposition seems extreme - those who should be allies appear disgusting or threatening (pig covered in dirt, wagon full of devils). You prepare to defend yourself or attack (draw the bow). But then you recognize the truth - these are not enemies but future family members (in-laws), people who will be closely connected to you. Your perception was distorted by the atmosphere of opposition. As you continue forward with this new understanding, the tension releases like rain that clears the air, bringing good fortune. This line counsels looking beyond the appearance of opposition to recognize potential kinship and connection.`,

  [39]: [
    `Line 1 - Going leads to obstruction, coming meets with praise. This line advises against pushing forward into obvious obstacles. Attempting to advance now only leads to greater difficulty. Instead, withdraw or hold your position (coming back) and you will be praised for your wisdom. This is about recognizing when not to proceed despite ambition or desire. The counsel is clear: retreat is the correct response to obstruction at this stage. There is no shame in turning back when the path is genuinely blocked. Your wisdom in recognizing this will be acknowledged and respected.`,
    `Line 2 - The king's servant meets obstruction upon obstruction. It is not his own fault. This line depicts someone facing difficulties while serving a higher purpose or authority. The obstacles are not of your making and not due to your failures. You are encountering difficulty because of your commitment to duty, to serving something beyond yourself. This is the obstruction that comes from loyalty and principle rather than from mistakes. Accept that serving what is right sometimes means encountering repeated difficulties. You are not to blame for circumstances you did not create. Continue your service with a clear conscience, knowing that the obstruction does not reflect on your character or capability.`,
    `Line 3 - Going leads to obstruction; hence you come back. This line repeats the message of the first line but from a more developed position. You recognize that forward progress leads to obstruction, so you deliberately turn back. This is conscious wisdom rather than mere circumstantial response. You see the obstacle ahead and choose to return to regroup, seek help, or await better conditions. This is strategic withdrawal based on clear understanding. The line praises this choice - coming back is the correct response. Sometimes the way forward is to consciously step back, and this demonstrates wisdom rather than weakness.`,
    `Line 4 - Going leads to obstruction; coming leads to union. This line suggests that while forward progress is blocked, returning or reaching out to others creates beneficial connections. The obstruction you face cannot be overcome alone, but by joining forces with others, combining resources and efforts, the situation can be addressed. This is about recognizing the need for alliance and support. Do not stubbornly continue alone into the obstacle. Instead, seek union with those who can help or who face similar challenges. Together, what seems impossible to one becomes achievable.`,
    `Line 5 - In the midst of the greatest obstruction, friends come. This line depicts the principle that help arrives precisely when most needed. When obstruction is at its worst, when the situation seems most hopeless, this is when true friends and genuine help appear. This is not about your effort but about the natural response of connection and support when difficulty is most severe. Trust that you are not ultimately alone even in the greatest obstruction. Those who can help will come. Your task is to persevere until help arrives, maintaining yourself through the darkest moment before relief appears. This line offers hope in the midst of the most severe difficulties.`,
    `Line 6 - Going leads to obstruction; coming leads to great good fortune. It furthers to see the great person. This line represents the resolution of obstruction through seeking guidance from those with wisdom and experience. Going forward on your own continues to lead to difficulty, but coming back to seek the counsel of the great person - whether a literal teacher, mentor, or the wisdom of tradition - brings great good fortune. After encountering severe obstruction (implied by this being the top line), you finally recognize the need for guidance beyond your own understanding. By seeking and following such guidance, the obstruction transforms into opportunity for learning and growth. This is the highest wisdom in the face of obstruction: recognizing when you need help and actively seeking those who can provide genuine guidance.`,

  [40]: [
    `Line 1 - No blame. After deliverance from difficulty, rest and recovery are appropriate. Do not immediately seek new challenges or activity. This line counsels that in the first stage after difficulty has passed, simple rest is the correct response. There is no need to prove anything or jump into action. The tension has released - allow yourself to recover. Being free of blame means that taking time to rest after hardship is not laziness but wisdom. Restore your energy before undertaking new projects or challenges.`,
    `Line 2 - Killing three foxes in the field and obtaining a yellow arrow brings perseverance and good fortune. This line uses hunting imagery to suggest eliminating remaining sources of trouble after the main difficulty has passed. The three foxes represent lingering problems, deceptions, or complications that remain after deliverance. The yellow arrow suggests using the middle way - balanced, centered action - to clear these remaining issues. By thoroughly addressing leftover problems with clear, centered action, you secure the deliverance and prevent backsliding. This brings lasting good fortune. After crisis passes, there is still cleanup work to be done, and attending to it carefully prevents new problems from developing.`,
    `Line 3 - Carrying a burden on your back and riding in a carriage at the same time invites robbers. Perseverance brings humiliation. This line warns against inappropriate behavior after deliverance. The image depicts someone of humble station (carrying a burden on their back like a porter) acting as if they have high status (riding in a carriage). This incongruity invites trouble - you make yourself a target by displaying what is not truly yours. After deliverance, do not become arrogant or assume a position you have not earned. Acting above your station or flaunting undeserved privileges invites exactly the kind of trouble you just escaped. Remain modest and appropriate to your actual circumstances. Pretense brings humiliation.`,
    `Line 4 - Deliver yourself from your big toe. Then the companion comes whom you can trust. This line counsels removing yourself from connections that hold you back. The big toe represents someone or something inferior that weighs you down or prevents free movement. Until you separate from this limiting connection, you cannot attract the beneficial relationships you need. Once you free yourself from what impedes you, trustworthy companions naturally appear. After deliverance from external difficulty, examine what internal or personal connections prevent your full freedom and progress. Have the courage to separate from what no longer serves, creating space for genuine allies to enter your life.`,
    `Line 5 - If the superior person can deliver themselves, good fortune. This proves to inferior people that they are in earnest. This line depicts self-liberation through one's own efforts and character. The superior person frees themselves from remaining entanglements through inner strength and clarity. This act of self-deliverance not only brings personal good fortune but also serves as an example and proof to others of your sincerity and capability. Your actions demonstrate that you are serious about freedom and growth. You cannot always control external deliverance, but you can always work toward internal freedom. By delivering yourself from internal obstacles - limiting beliefs, harmful habits, unworthy attachments - you create both personal fortune and inspire confidence in others.`,
    `Line 6 - The prince shoots at a hawk on a high wall and kills it. Everything serves to further. This line depicts the elimination of the highest remaining threat after deliverance. The hawk on the high wall represents a final, elevated obstacle - perhaps a proud, predatory element that remains dangerous even after other difficulties have been resolved. The prince (representing proper authority and skill) successfully removes this final threat. With this accomplished, everything truly is resolved and nothing remains to impede progress. This is complete deliverance achieved through skillful, decisive action against the last significant problem. After this, all undertakings are favored because all obstacles have been cleared. This line promises comprehensive success following thorough resolution of difficulties.`,
